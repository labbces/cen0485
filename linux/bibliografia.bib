  abstract = {Abscisic acid ({ABA})-response promoter complexes ({ABRC}s), consisting
	of an {ACGT} core-containing element ({ACGT} box) and a coupling
	element ({CE}), have been shown to be necessary and sufficient for
	{ABA} induction of gene expression in cereal plants. {I}n this work,
	the component elements of two {ABRC}s are defined in terms of base
	sequence, orientation, and distance from each other. {T}he {ACGT}
	element requires the sequence 5'-{ACGTGGC}-3' and the elements {CE}1
	and {CE}3 require the sequences {CCACC} and {GCGTGTC}, respectively.
	{T}he {ACGT} element and {CE}3 are next to each other in the barley
	{ABA}-inducible gene {HVA}1, and lengthening the distance between
	them gradually decreases their activity in conferring {ABA} response.
	{O}n the other hand, the {ACGT} element and {CE}1 are separated by
	about 20 bp in the promoter of another {ABA}-inducible gene, {HVA}22,
	and need to be separated by multiples of 10 bp in order to confer
	high {ABA} induction, suggesting that these two elements have to
	be located in the same side of the {DNA} double helix. {A}lthough
	the coupling between an {ACGT} box and a {CE} is sufficient for {ABA}
	induction, two copies of the {ACGT} element are equally active. {H}owever,
	two copies of {CE}3 appear to be less active. {S}pecific interactions
	between {ABRC} and nuclear proteins have been detected. {I}n vitro
	binding activities of nuclear proteins to an {ABRC} and to its mutant
	forms appear to be proportional to the biological activities of these
	sequences in vivo. {O}ur data suggest that the specific response
	to {ABA} is determined by the presence of two {ACGT} boxes or an
	{ACGT} box plus a {CE} as well as by the flanking sequences of the
	{ACGT} boxes and the {CE}s.},

  year = {2010},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The zinc-finger transcription factor GLI3 is an important
	mediator of Sonic hedgehog signaling and crucial for patterning of
	many aspects of the vertebrate body plan. In vertebrates, the mechanism
	of SHH signal transduction and its action on target genes by means
	of activating or repressing forms of GLI3 have been studied most
	extensively during limb development and the specification of the
	central nervous system. From these studies it has emerged, that Gli3
	expression must be subject to a tight spatiotemporal regulation.
	However, the genetic mechanisms and the cis-acting elements controlling
	the expression of Gli3 remained largely unknown. RESULTS: Here, we
	demonstrate in chicken and mouse transgenic embryos that human GLI3-intronic
	conserved non-coding sequence elements (CNEs) autonomously control
	individual aspects of Gli3 expression. Their combined action shows
	many aspects of a Gli3-specific pattern of transcriptional activity.
	In the mouse limb bud, different CNEs enhance Gli3-specific expression
	in evolutionary ancient stylopod and zeugopod versus modern skeletal
	structures of the autopod. Limb bud specificity is also found in
	chicken but had not been detected in zebrafish embryos. Three of
	these elements govern central nervous system specific gene expression
	during mouse embryogenesis, each targeting a subset of endogenous
	Gli3 transcription sites. Even though fish, birds, and mammals share
	an ancient repertoire of gene regulatory elements within Gli3, the
	functions of individual enhancers from this catalog have diverged
	significantly. During evolution, ancient broad-range regulatory elements
	within Gli3 attained higher specificity, critical for patterning
	of more specialized structures, by abolishing the potential for redundant
	expression control. CONCLUSION: These results not only demonstrate
	the high level of complexity in the genetic mechanisms controlling
	Gli3 expression, but also reveal the evolutionary significance of
	cis-acting regulatory networks of early developmental regulators
	in vertebrates.},

  abstract = {The emergence of order in natural systems is a constant source of
	inspiration for both physical and biological sciences. {W}hile the
	spatial order characterizing for example the crystals has been the
	basis of many advances in contemporary physics, most complex systems
	in nature do not offer such high degree of order. {M}any of these
	systems form complex networks whose nodes are the elements of the
	system and edges represent the interactions between them. {T}raditionally
	complex networks have been described by the random graph theory founded
	in 1959 by {P}aul {E}rd ?os and {A}lfr ?ed {R} ?enyi. {O}ne of the
	defining features of random graphs is that they are statistically
	homogeneous, and their degree distribution (characterizing the spread
	in the number of edges starting from a node) is a {P}oisson distribution.
	{I}n contrast, recent empirical studies, including the work of our
	group, indicate that the topology of real networks is much richer
	than that of random graphs. {I}n particular, the degree distribution
	of real networks is a powerlaw, indicating a heterogeneous topology
	in which the majority of the nodes have a small degree, but there
	is a significant fraction of highly connected nodes that play an
	important role in the connectivity of the network. {T}he scale-free
	topology of real networks has very important consequences on their
	functioning. {F}or example, we have discovered that scale-free networks
	are extremely resilient to the random disruption of their nodes.
	{O}n the other hand, theselective removal of the nodes with highest
	degree induces a rapid breakdown of the network to isolated subparts
	that cannot communicate with each other. {T}he non-trivial scaling
	of the degree distribution of real networks is also an indication
	of their assembly and evolution. {I}ndeed, our modeling studies have
	shown us that there are general principles governing the evolution
	of networks. {M}ost networks start from a small seed and grow by
	the addition of new nodes which attach to the nodes already in the
	system. {T}his process obeys preferential attachment: the new nodes
	are more likely to connect to nodes with already high degree. {W}e
	have proposed a simple model based on these two principles wich was
	able to reproduce the power-law degree distribution of real networks.
	{P}erhaps even more importantly, this model paved the way to a new
	paradigm of network modeling, trying to capture the evolution of
	networks, not just their static topology.},

	We provide a model based on known gene regulatory networks whereby
	positive selection on a single, partially redundant gene duplicate
	'trapped' the ancestors of flower-bearing plants into the condensed,

	possible to identify orthologous genes descending from a common ancestor.
	{H}owever, reconstruction of evolutionary history over long time
	periods faces many challenges due to gene duplications and losses.
	{I}dentification of orthologous groups shared by multiple proteomes
	therefore becomes a clustering problem in which an optimal compromise
	between conflicting evidences needs to be found. {RESULTS}: {H}ere
	we present a new proteome-scale analysis program called {M}ulti{P}aranoid
	that can automatically find orthology relationships between proteins
	in multiple proteomes. {T}he software is an extension of the {I}n{P}aranoid
	program that identifies orthologs and inparalogs in pairwise proteome
	comparisons. {M}ulti{P}aranoid applies a clustering algorithm to
	merge multiple pairwise ortholog groups from {I}n{P}aranoid into
	multi-species ortholog groups. {T}o avoid outparalogs in the same
	cluster, {M}ulti{P}aranoid only combines species that share the same
	last ancestor. {T}o validate the clustering technique, we compared
	the results to a reference set obtained by manual phylogenetic analysis.
	{W}e further compared the results to ortholog groups in {KOG}s and
	{O}rtho{MCL}, which revealed that {M}ulti{P}aranoid produces substantially
	fewer outparalogs than these resources. {AVAILABILITY}: {M}ulti{P}aranoid
	is a freely available standalone program that enables efficient orthology
	analysis much needed in the post-genomic era. {A} web-based service
	providing access to the original datasets, the resulting groups of
	orthologs, and the source code of the program can be found at http://multiparanoid.cgb.ki.se.},

  abstract = {The similarity of two nucleotide sequences is often expressed in terms
	of evolutionary distance, a measure of the amount of change needed
	to transform one sequence into the other. {G}iven two sequences with
	a small distance between them, can their similarity be explained
	by their base composition alone? {T}he nucleotide order of these
	sequences contributes to their similarity if the distance is much
	smaller than their average permutation distance, which is obtained
	by calculating the distances for many random permutations of these
	sequences. {T}o determine whether their similarity can be explained
	by their dinucleotide and codon usage, random sequences must be chosen
	from the set of permuted sequences that preserve dinucleotide and
	codon usage. {T}he problem of choosing random dinucleotide and codon-preserving
	permutations can be expressed in the language of graph theory as
	the problem of generating random {E}ulerian walks on a directed multigraph.
	{A}n efficient algorithm for generating such walks is described.
	{T}his algorithm can be used to choose random sequence permutations
	that preserve (1) dinucleotide usage, (2) dinucleotide and trinucleotide
	usage, or (3) dinucleotide and codon usage. {F}or example, the similarity
	of two 60-nucleotide {DNA} segments from the human beta-1 interferon
	gene (nucleotides 196-255 and 499-558) is not just the result of
	their nonrandom dinucleotide and codon usage.},

	that are processed from hairpin precursor transcripts by {D}icer.
	mi{RNA}s probably inhibit translation of m{RNA}s via imprecise antisense
	base-pairing. {S}mall interfering {RNA}s (si{RNA}s) are similar in
	size to mi{RNA}s, but they recognize targets by precise complementarity
	and elicit {RNA}-mediated interference ({RNA}i). {W}e employed c{DNA}
	sequencing and comparative genomics to identify additional {C}. elegans
	small {RNA}s with properties similar to mi{RNA}s and si{RNA}s. {RESULTS}:
	{W}e found three broad classes of small {RNA}s in {C}. elegans: (1)
	21 new mi{RNA} genes (we estimate that {C}. elegans contains approximately
	100 distinct mi{RNA} genes, about 30\% of which are conserved in
	vertebrates; (2), 33 distinct members of a class of tiny noncoding
	{RNA} (tnc{RNA}) genes with transcripts that are similar in length
	to mi{RNA}s (approximately 20-21 nt) and that are in some cases developmentally
	regulated but are apparently not processed from a mi{RNA}-like hairpin
	precursor and are not phylogenetically conserved; (3) more than 700
	distinct small antisense {RNA}s, about 20 nt long, that are precisely
	complementary to protein coding regions of more than 500 different
	genes and therefore seem to be endogenous si{RNA}s. {CONCLUSIONS}:
	{T}he presence of diverse endogenous si{RNA}s in normal worms suggests
	ongoing, genome-wide gene silencing by {RNA}i. mi{RNA}s and tnc{RNA}s
	are not predicted to form complete {W}atson-{C}rick hybrids with
	any {C}. elegans {RNA} target, and so they are likely to regulate
	the activity of other genes by non-{RNA}i mechanisms. {T}hese results
	suggest that diverse modes of small {RNA}-mediated gene regulation

  abstract = {The point of view of external observers has led to an explanation
	of life based on digitally encoded information. {I}n contrast, the
	existence of natural internal observers, or agents that belong to
	the same scale of the observed objects, explains the appearance of
	form centered approaches. {T}he main controversies in thermodynamics
	and evolution are due to the changes of perspective, so as to speak,
	if measurement is considered to be external or internal. {E}quilibrium
	theories developed for closed systems under ideal conditions are
	analogous to external measurements. {O}n the other hand, morphogenetic
	perspectives as far from equilibrium thermodynamics applicable to
	open systems allow to imagine self-organizing agents that perform
	local measurements. {C}haitin's algorithmic approach would help to
	elucidate the relation between digitally encoded information and
	active forms, because forms and shapes are responsible for specific
	pattern recognition and play a major role in the process of finding
	the proper measuring standard. {T}he predominance of form over digital
	records is illustrated by studying the mapping between genetic descriptions
	and functional shapes, originally suggested for {RNA}, by {S}chuster.
	{T}herefore, interactions between living entities are seen as reciprocal
	measurement processes that bring about couplings (shortened descriptions
	and local decreases of entropy) that are paid by partial record erasure
	(increase of entropy). {T}o conclude, this approach centered on the
	inner dynamics or form is appropriate for understanding how {L}amarckism
	and the modern neutral theory of evolution can be integrated for
	expanding the neo{D}arwinian perspective.},

	we take the global approach of annotating the suffix tree of a sequence

	detector of all unexpected behaviors, or perhaps just as a preliminary
	filter for words suspicious enough to undergo a more accurate scrutiny.
	{W}e consider in depth the simple probabilistic model in which sequences

	independently and according to a given distribution. {O}ur main result
	consists of showing that, within this model, full tree annotations
	can be carried out in a time-and-space optimal fashion for the mean,
	variance and some of the adopted measures of significance. {T}his

	{T}he {O} (n2) time bound constitutes an improvement by a linear

	over- or underrepresented words are restricted to the {O}(n) words

	the theta(n2) possible substrings. {T}his surprising fact is a consequence

  abstract = {B{ACKGROUND}: {M}otif patterns of maximal saturation emerged originally
	in contexts of pattern discovery in biomolecular sequences and have
	recently proven a valuable notion also in the design of data compression
	schemes. {I}nformally, a motif is a string of intermittently solid
	and wild characters that recurs more or less frequently in an input
	sequence or family of sequences. {M}otif discovery techniques and
	tools tend to be computationally imposing, however, special classes
	of "rigid" motifs have been identified of which the discovery is
	affordable in low polynomial time. {RESULTS}: {I}n the present work,
	"extensible" motifs are considered such that each sequence of gaps
	comes endowed with some elasticity, whereby the same pattern may
	be stretched to fit segments of the source that match all the solid
	characters but are otherwise of different lengths. {A} few applications
	of this notion are then described. {I}n applications of data compression
	by textual substitution, extensible motifs are seen to bring savings
	on the size of the codebook, and hence to improve compression. {I}n
	germane contexts, in which compressibility is used in its dual role
	as a basis for structural inference and classification, extensible
	motifs are seen to support unsupervised classification and phylogeny
	reconstruction. {CONCLUSION}: {O}ff-line compression based on extensible
	motifs can be used advantageously to compress and classify biological

	study conducted in 25 {S}panish {SCHU}s. {A} total of 2130 men with
	essential hypertension under treatment were recruited. {I}n a second
	phase, 291 subjects with a score < or = 21 in the {S}exual {H}ealth
	{I}nventory for {M}en ({SHIM}) received sildenafil (50 mg/day) as
	required 30 to 60 minutes before sexual activity, and were evaluated
	by the {I}nternational {I}ndex of {E}rectile {F}unction ({IIEF}).
	{RESULTS}: {A} total of 975 subjects (45.8\%) had a score < or =
	21 in the {SHIM}. {I}n the second phase, sildenafil improved the
	score in the erectile function domain in 232 patients (83.2\%). {S}everity
	of {ED} significantly improved ({P} <.001); severe (22.3\% to 7.7\%),
	moderate (23\% to 5.6\%), and mild impairment (36.3\% to 44.8\%).
	{T}he {IIEF} was normalized in 39.1\% of patients who completed post-treatment
	{IIEF}. {I}n all, 33 subjects (11.8\%) failed to complete the study:
	two (0.7\%) because of lack of efficacy, two (0.7\%) intercurrent
	disease, 10 (3.6\%) failure to return to the visits, three (1.1\%)
	fear of therapy, four (1.4\%) adverse effects requiring treatment
	discontinuation, and 12 (4.3\%) protocol violations. {N}o statistically
	significant association was found between the prevalence of adverse
	effects and antihypertensive treatment with single drug or combination
	therapy. {CONCLUSIONS}: {A} high incidence of {ED} was found in hypertensive
	patients from {S}panish {SCHU}s. {S}ildenafil showed an excellent

  abstract = {Likely {DNA}-binding domains in archaeal proteins were analyzed using
	sequence profile methods and available structural information. {I}t
	is shown that all archaea encode a large number of proteins containing
	the helix-turn-helix ({HTH}) {DNA}-binding domains whose sequences
	are much more similar to bacterial {HTH} domains than to eukaryotic
	ones, such as the {PAIRED}, {POU} and homeodomains. {T}he predominant
	class of {HTH} domains in archaea is the winged-{HTH} domain. {T}he
	number and diversity of {HTH} domains in archaea is comparable to
	that seen in bacteria. {T}he {HTH} domain in archaea combines with
	a variety of other domains that include replication system components,
	such as {MCM} proteins, translation system components, such as the
	alpha-subunit of phenyl-alanyl-t{RNA} synthetase, and several metabolic
	enzymes. {T}he majority of the archaeal {HTH}-containing proteins
	are predicted to be gene/operon-specific transcriptional regulators.
	{T}his apparent bacterial-type mode of transcription regulation is
	in sharp contrast to the eukaryote-like layout of the core transcription
	machinery in the archaea. {I}n addition to the predicted bacterial-type
	transcriptional regulators, the {HTH} domain is conserved in archaeal
	and eukaryotic core transcription factors, such as {TFIIB}, {TFIIE}-alpha
	and {MBF}1. {MBF}1 is the only highly conserved, classical {HTH}
	domain that is vertically inherited in all archaea and eukaryotes.
	{I}n contrast, while eukaryotic {TFIIB} and {TFIIE}-alpha possess
	forms of the {HTH} domain that are divergent in sequence, their archaeal
	counterparts contain typical {HTH} domains. {I}t is shown that, besides
	the {HTH} domain, archaea encode unexpectedly large numbers of two
	other predicted {DNA}-binding domains, namely the {A}rc/{M}et{J}
	domain and the {Z}n-ribbon. {T}he core transcription regulators in
	archaea and eukaryotes ({TFIIB}/{TFB}, {TFIIE}-alpha and {MBF}1)
	and in bacteria (the sigma factors) share no similarity beyond the
	presence of distinct {HTH} domains. {T}hus {HTH} domains might have
	been independently recruited for a role in transcription regulation
	in the bacterial and archaeal/eukaryotic lineages. {D}uring subsequent
	evolution, the similarity between archaeal and bacterial gene/operon
	transcriptional regulators might have been established and maintained
	through multiple horizontal gene transfer events.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medium- to large-scale expression profiling using quantitative
	polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays are becoming increasingly
	important in genomics research. A major bottleneck in experiment
	preparation is the design of specific primer pairs, where researchers
	have to make several informed choices, often outside their area of
	expertise. Using currently available primer design tools, several
	interactive decisions have to be made, resulting in lengthy design
	processes with varying qualities of the assays. RESULTS: Here we
	present QuantPrime, an intuitive and user-friendly, fully automated
	tool for primer pair design in small- to large-scale qPCR analyses.
	QuantPrime can be used online through the internet http://www.quantprime.de/
	or on a local computer after download; it offers design and specificity
	checking with highly customizable parameters and is ready to use
	with many publicly available transcriptomes of important higher eukaryotic
	model organisms and plant crops (currently 295 species in total),
	while benefiting from exon-intron border and alternative splice variant
	information in available genome annotations. Experimental results
	with the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the crop Hordeum vulgare
	and the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii show success rates
	of designed primer pairs exceeding 96\%. CONCLUSION: QuantPrime constitutes
	a flexible, fully automated web application for reliable primer design
	for use in larger qPCR experiments, as proven by experimental data.
	The flexible framework is also open for simple use in other quantification
	applications, such as hydrolyzation probe design for qPCR and oligonucleotide
	probe design for quantitative in situ hybridization. Future suggestions
	made by users can be easily implemented, thus allowing QuantPrime
	to be developed into a broad-range platform for the design of RNA
	expression assays.},

  abstract = {B{ACKGROUND}: {T}housands of genes in a genomewide data set are tested
	against some null hypothesis, for detecting differentially expressed
	genes in microarray experiments. {T}he expected proportion of false
	positive genes in a set of genes, called the {F}alse {D}iscovery
	{R}ate ({FDR}), has been proposed to measure the statistical significance
	of this set. {V}arious procedures exist for controlling the {FDR}.
	{H}owever the threshold (generally 5\%) is arbitrary and a specific
	measure associated with each gene would be worthwhile. {RESULTS}:
	{U}sing process intensity estimation methods, we define and give
	estimates of the local {FDR}, which may be considered as the probability
	for a gene to be a false positive. {A}fter a global assessment rule
	controlling the false positive error, the local {FDR} is a valuable
	guideline for deciding wether a gene is differentially expressed.
	{T}he interest of the method is illustrated on three well known data
	sets. {A} {R} routine for computing local {FDR} estimates from p-values
	is available at http://www.inapg.fr/ens_rech/mathinfo/recherche/mathematique/outil.html.

	(approximately) independent measures of the membership of a sequence
	(or sequence region) in some class are often available. {W}e would
	like to estimate the likelihood of the sequence being a member of
	the class in view of all the available evidence. {A}n example is
	estimating the significance of the observed match of a macromolecular
	sequence ({DNA} or protein) to a set of patterns (motifs) that characterize
	a biological sequence family. {A}n intuitive way to do this is to
	express each piece of evidence as a p-value, and then use the product
	of these p-values as the measure of membership in the family. {W}e
	derive a formula and algorithm ({QFAST}) for calculating the statistical
	distribution of the product of n independent p-values. {W}e demonstrate
	that sorting sequences by this p-value effectively combines the information
	present in multiple motifs, leading to highly accurate and sensitive

  abstract = {M{EME} is a tool for discovering motifs in sets of protein or {DNA}
	sequences. {T}his paper describes several extensions to {MEME} which
	increase its ability to find motifs in a totally unsupervised fashion,
	but which also allow it to benefit when prior knowledge is available.
	{W}hen no background knowledge is asserted. {MEME} obtains increased
	robustness from a method for determining motif widths automatically,
	and from probabilistic models that allow motifs to be absent in some
	input sequences. {O}n the other hand, {MEME} can exploit prior knowledge
	about a motif being present in all input sequences, about the length
	of a motif and whether it is a palindrome, and (using {D}irichlet
	mixtures) about expected patterns in individual motif positions.
	{E}xtensive experiments are reported which support the claim that
	{MEME} benefits from, but does not require, background knowledge.

	(ii) a greater percentage of the orthologous genes of smaller genomes
	is contained in other species than is the case for larger genomes,

	before species can be specifically related to one another in terms
	of gene content, it is first necessary to correct for the size of
	the genome; (iv) eukaryotes have a significantly smaller percentage
	of bacterial orthologs after correction for genome size, which is
	consistent with their placement in a separate domain; (v) the archaebacteria
	are specifically related to one another but are not significantly
	different in gene content from the bacteria as a whole; (vi) determination
	of the mean identity of all orthologs (involving hundreds of gene
	comparisons per genome pair) reduces the impact of errors in misidentification
	of orthologs and to misalignments, and thus it is far more reliable
	than single gene comparisons; (vii) however, there is a maximum amount
	of change in protein sequences of 37\% mean identity, which limits
	the use of percentage sequence identity to the lower taxa, a result
	which should also be true for single gene comparisons of both proteins
	and r{RNA}; (viii) most of the species that appear to be specifically
	related based upon gene content also appear to be specifically related
	based upon the mean identity of orthologs; (ix) the genes of a majority
	of species considered in this study have diverged too much to allow
	the construction of all-encompassing evolutionary trees. {H}owever,

	adaptation decelerated sharply, genomic evolution was nearly constant
	for 20,000 generations. Such clock-like regularity is usually viewed
	as the signature of neutral evolution, but several lines of evidence
	indicate that almost all of these mutations were beneficial. This
	same population later evolved an elevated mutation rate and accumulated
	hundreds of additional mutations dominated by a neutral signature.
	Thus, the coupling between genomic and adaptive evolution is complex
	and can be counterintuitive even in a constant environment. In particular,
	beneficial substitutions were surprisingly uniform over time, whereas
	neutral substitutions were highly variable.},

	a challenging task even though the number of sequenced genomes is
	constantly growing. {C}omputational analyses using pattern search
	algorithms have been valuable in phylogenetic footprinting approaches
	as have expression profile experiments to predict co-occurring motifs.
	{S}urprisingly little is known about the nature of cis-regulatory
	element ({CRE}) distribution in promoters. {RESULTS}: {I}n this paper
	we used the {M}otif {M}apper open-source collection of visual basic
	scripts for the analysis of motifs in any aligned set of {DNA} sequences.
	{W}e focused on promoter motif distribution curves to identify positional
	over-representation of {DNA} motifs. {U}sing differentially aligned
	datasets from the model species {A}rabidopsis thaliana, {C}aenorhabditis
	elegans, {D}rosophila melanogaster and {S}accharomyces cerevisiae,
	we convincingly demonstrated the importance of the position and orientation
	for motif discovery. {A}nalysis with known {CRE}s and all possible
	hexanucleotides showed that some functional elements gather close
	to the transcription and translation initiation sites and that elements
	other than the {TATA}-box motif are conserved between eukaryote promoters.
	{W}hile a high background frequency usually decreases the effectiveness
	of such an enumerative investigation, we improved our analysis by
	conducting motif distribution maps using large datasets. {CONCLUSION}:
	{T}his is the first study to reveal positional over-representation
	of {CRE}s and promoter motifs in a cross-species approach. {CRE}s
	and motifs shared between eukaryotic promoters support the observation
	that an eukaryotic promoter structure has been conserved throughout
	evolutionary time. {F}urthermore, with the information on positional
	enrichment of a motif or a known functional {CRE}, it is possible
	to get a more detailed insight into where an element appears to function.
	{T}his in turn might accelerate the in depth examination of known
	and yet unknown cis-regulatory sequences in the laboratory.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary traces of thermophilic adaptation are manifest, on the
	whole-genome level, in compositional biases toward certain types
	of amino acids. However, it is sometimes difficult to discern their
	causes without a clear understanding of underlying physical mechanisms
	of thermal stabilization of proteins. For example, it is well-known
	that hyperthermophiles feature a greater proportion of charged residues,
	but, surprisingly, the excess of positively charged residues is almost
	entirely due to lysines but not arginines in the majority of hyperthermophilic
	genomes. All-atom simulations show that lysines have a much greater
	number of accessible rotamers than arginines of similar degree of
	burial in folded states of proteins. This finding suggests that lysines
	would preferentially entropically stabilize the native state. Indeed,
	we show in computational experiments that arginine-to-lysine amino
	acid substitutions result in noticeable stabilization of proteins.
	We then hypothesize that if evolution uses this physical mechanism
	as a complement to electrostatic stabilization in its strategies
	of thermophilic adaptation, then hyperthermostable organisms would
	have much greater content of lysines in their proteomes than comparably
	sized and similarly charged arginines. Consistent with that, high-throughput
	comparative analysis of complete proteomes shows extremely strong
	bias toward arginine-to-lysine replacement in hyperthermophilic organisms
	and overall much greater content of lysines than arginines in hyperthermophiles.
	This finding cannot be explained by genomic GC compositional biases
	or by the universal trend of amino acid gain and loss in protein
	evolution. We discovered here a novel entropic mechanism of protein
	thermostability due to residual dynamics of rotamer isomerization
	in native state and demonstrated its immediate proteomic implications.
	Our study provides an example of how analysis of a fundamental physical
	mechanism of thermostability helps to resolve a puzzle in comparative
	genomics as to why amino acid compositions of hyperthermophilic proteomes
	are significantly biased toward lysines but not similarly charged
	arginines.},

  abstract = {B{ACKGROUND}: {G}ene duplication and gene loss during the evolution
	of eukaryotes have hindered attempts to estimate phylogenies and
	divergence times of species. {A}lthough current methods that identify
	clusters of orthologous genes in complete genomes have helped to
	investigate gene function and gene content, they have not been optimized
	for evolutionary sequence analyses requiring strict orthology and
	complete gene matrices. {H}ere we adopt a relatively simple and fast
	genome comparison approach designed to assemble orthologs for evolutionary
	analysis. {O}ur approach identifies single-copy genes representing
	only species divergences (panorthologs) in order to minimize potential
	errors caused by gene duplication. {W}e apply this approach to complete
	sets of proteins from published eukaryote genomes specifically for
	phylogeny and time estimation. {RESULTS}: {D}espite the conservative
	criterion used, 753 panorthologs (proteins) were identified for evolutionary
	analysis with four genomes, resulting in a single alignment of 287,000
	amino acids. {W}ith this data set, we estimate that the divergence
	between deuterostomes and arthropods took place in the {P}recambrian,
	approximately 400 million years before the first appearance of animals
	in the fossil record. {A}dditional analyses were performed with seven,
	12, and 15 eukaryote genomes resulting in similar divergence time
	estimates and phylogenies. {CONCLUSION}: {O}ur results with available
	eukaryote genomes agree with previous results using conventional
	methods of sequence data assembly from genomes. {T}hey show that
	large sequence data sets can be generated relatively quickly and
	efficiently for evolutionary analyses of complete genomes.},

	but rarely tested. Twelve initially identical populations of Escherichia
	coli were founded in 1988 to investigate this issue. They have since
	evolved in a glucose-limited medium that also contains citrate, which
	E. coli cannot use as a carbon source under oxic conditions. No population
	evolved the capacity to exploit citrate for >30,000 generations,
	although each population tested billions of mutations. A citrate-using
	(Cit+) variant finally evolved in one population by 31,500 generations,
	causing an increase in population size and diversity. The long-delayed
	and unique evolution of this function might indicate the involvement
	of some extremely rare mutation. Alternately, it may involve an ordinary
	mutation, but one whose physical occurrence or phenotypic expression
	is contingent on prior mutations in that population. We tested these
	hypotheses in experiments that "replayed" evolution from different
	points in that population's history. We observed no Cit+ mutants
	among 8.4 x 10(12) ancestral cells, nor among 9 x 10(12) cells from
	60 clones sampled in the first 15,000 generations. However, we observed
	a significantly greater tendency for later clones to evolve Cit+,
	indicating that some potentiating mutation arose by 20,000 generations.
	This potentiating change increased the mutation rate to Cit+ but
	did not cause generalized hypermutability. Thus, the evolution of
	this phenotype was contingent on the particular history of that population.
	More generally, we suggest that historical contingency is especially
	important when it facilitates the evolution of key innovations that
	are not easily evolved by gradual, cumulative selection.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microbial hosts offer a number of unique advantages when
	used as production systems for both native and heterologous small-molecules.
	These advantages include high selectivity and benign environmental
	impact; however, a principal drawback is low yield and/or productivity,
	which limits economic viability. Therefore a major challenge in developing
	a microbial production system is to maximize formation of a specific
	product while sustaining cell growth. Tools to rationally reconfigure
	microbial metabolism for these potentially conflicting objectives
	remain limited. Exhaustively exploring combinations of genetic modifications
	is both experimentally and computationally inefficient, and can become
	intractable when multiple gene deletions or insertions need to be
	considered. Alternatively, the search for desirable gene modifications
	may be solved heuristically as an evolutionary optimization problem.
	In this study, we combine a genetic algorithm and elementary mode
	analysis to develop an optimization framework for evolving metabolic
	networks with energetically favorable pathways for production of
	both biomass and a compound of interest. RESULTS: Utilization of
	thermodynamically-weighted elementary modes for flux reconstruction
	of E. coli central metabolism revealed two clusters of EMs with respect
	to their Delta Gp degrees. For proof of principle testing, the algorithm
	was applied to ethanol and lycopene production in E. coli. The algorithm
	was used to optimize product formation, biomass formation, and product
	and biomass formation simultaneously. Predicted knockouts often matched
	those that have previously been implemented experimentally for improved
	product formation. The performance of a multi-objective genetic algorithm
	showed that it is better to couple the two objectives in a single
	objective genetic algorithm. CONCLUSION: A computationally tractable
	framework is presented for the redesign of metabolic networks for
	maximal product formation combining elementary mode analysis (a form
	of convex analysis), pathway thermodynamics, and a genetic algorithm
	to optimize the production of two industrially-relevant products,
	ethanol and lycopene, from E. coli. The designed algorithm can be
	applied to any small-scale model of cellular metabolism theoretically
	utilizing any substrate and applied towards the production of any
	product.},

  abstract = {Conversion of genetic information from {RNA} into {DNA} by reverse
	transcription is ancient and was instrumental for the transition
	from the {RNP} world to modern cells ({B}rosius, 1999a, {N}at. {G}enet.,
	22, 8-9; {B}rosius, 2003, {J}. {S}truct. {F}unct. {G}enom., 3, 1-17).
	{S}urprisingly, in many eukaryotic lineages, the process of retroposition
	is still very active. {A}ll types of {RNA}s ({B}rosius, 1999b, {G}ene,
	238, 115-134) can be reverse transcribed and their c{DNA} copies
	reintegrated into genomes as retronuons (a nuon is any discrete segment
	of nucleic acid ({B}rosius and {G}ould, 1992, {PROC}: {N}atl {A}cad.
	{S}ci. {USA}, 89, 10706-10710)). {A}bout 38\% or 42\% of the mouse
	and human genomes, respectively, consist of discernible retronuons
	(excluding m{RNA}-derived retroposons). {O}nly 1.5\% of the human
	genome consists of exons coding for proteins. {E}ven considering
	{DNA} transposons ( approximately 1-3\% discernible), slippage during
	replication and a relatively large fraction derived from segmental
	duplications it is conceivable that the remainder of mammalian genomes
	is probably derived from ancient, today non-discernible retronuons.
	{H}ence, the vast majority of mammalian genomes have been contributed
	by retroposition. {R}etroposition predominantly leads to 'junk {DNA}'.
	{H}owever, m{RNA}-derived retronuons are known to give rise to active
	genes, often with different expression patterns than their respective
	founder genes ({B}rosius and {G}ould, 1992, {PROC}: {N}atl {A}cad.
	{S}ci. {USA}, 89, 10706-10710; {B}rosius, 1991, {S}cience, 251, 753).
	{R}etronuons derived from small non-messenger {RNA}s (snm{RNA}s)
	generate novel snm{RNA} genes (such as the neuron-specific {BC}1
	and {BC}200 {RNA}s) ({B}rosius, 1999b, {G}ene, 238, 115-134; {B}rosius
	and {G}ould, 1992, {PROC}: {N}atl {A}cad. {S}ci. {USA}, 89, 10706-10710).
	{F}requently, retronuons are exapted (co-opted) as regulatory elements
	that may alter expression or processing of targeted genes ({B}rosius
	and {G}ould, 1992, {PROC}: {N}atl {A}cad. {S}ci. {USA}, 89, 10706-10710)
	(for compilations see http://www-ifi.uni-muenster.de/exapted-retrogenes/tables.html).
	{C}onsequently, retronuons are a major driving force of evolution
	and perhaps even speciation. {C}omparison of the human genome with
	that of other mammals such as mouse or, in particular, chimpanzee
	reveals that neither contains numerous additional genes. {I}nstead,
	one observes exaptation of novel exons (often involving alternative
	splicing) from previously nonaptive intronic (as predicted by {G}ilbert,
	1978, {N}ature, 271, 501) or flanking sequences originally generated
	by retroposition. {F}urthermore, the differential expression of shared
	genes with respect to developmental onset and/or cell-type specificity,
	that is triggered by de novo insertions of retronuons, will turn
	out to be a recurrent theme in species differences at the genomic
	level. {C}ontact: {RNA}.worldwuni-muenster.de},

  abstract = {M{OTIVATION}: {T}o compare entire genomes from different species,
	biologists increasingly need alignment methods that are efficient
	enough to handle long sequences, and accurate enough to correctly
	align the conserved biological features between distant species.
	{T}he two main classes of pairwise alignments are global alignment,
	where one string is transformed into the other, and local alignment,
	where all locations of similarity between the two strings are returned.
	{G}lobal alignments are less prone to demonstrating false homology
	as each letter of one sequence is constrained to being aligned to
	only one letter of the other. {L}ocal alignments, on the other hand,
	can cope with rearrangements between non-syntenic, orthologous sequences
	by identifying similar regions in sequences; this, however, comes
	at the expense of a higher false positive rate due to the inability
	of local aligners to take into account overall conservation maps.
	{RESULTS}: {I}n this paper we introduce the notion of glocal alignment,
	a combination of global and local methods, where one creates a map
	that transforms one sequence into the other while allowing for rearrangement
	events. {W}e present {S}huffle-{LAGAN}, a glocal alignment algorithm
	that is based on the {CHAOS} local alignment algorithm and the {LAGAN}
	global aligner, and is able to align long genomic sequences. {T}o
	test {S}huffle-{LAGAN} we split the mouse genome into {BAC}-sized
	pieces, and aligned these pieces to the human genome. {W}e demonstrate
	that {S}huffle-{LAGAN} compares favorably in terms of sensitivity
	and specificity with standard local and global aligners. {F}rom the
	alignments we conclude that about 9\% of human/mouse homology may
	be attributed to small rearrangements, 63\% of which are duplications.},

  abstract = {B{ACKGROUND}: {SSH} has emerged as a widely used technology to identify
	genes that are differentially regulated between two biological situations.
	{B}ecause it includes a normalisation step, it is used for preference
	to clone low abundance differentially expressed transcripts. {I}t
	does not require previous sequence knowledge and may start from {PCR}
	amplified c{DNA}s. {I}t is thus particularly well suited to biological
	situations where specific genes are expressed and tiny amounts of
	{RNA} are available. {T}his is the case during early mammalian embryo
	development. {I}n this field, few differentially expressed genes
	have been characterized from {SSH} libraries, but an overall assessment
	of the quality of {SSH} libraries is still required. {B}ecause we
	are interested in the more systematic establishment of {SSH} libraries
	from early embryos, we have developed a simple and reliable strategy
	based on reporter transcript follow-up to check {SSH} library quality
	and repeatability when starting with small amounts of {RNA}. {RESULTS}:
	{F}our independent subtracted libraries were constructed. {T}hey
	aimed to analyze key events in the preimplantation development of
	rabbit and bovine embryos. {T}he performance of the {SSH} procedure
	was assessed through the large-scale screening of thousands of clones
	from each library for exogenous reporter transcripts mimicking either
	tester specific or tester/driver common transcripts. {O}ur results
	show that abundant transcripts escape normalisation which is only
	efficient for rare and moderately abundant transcripts. {S}equencing
	1600 clones from one of the libraries confirmed and extended our
	results to endogenous transcripts and demonstrated that some very
	abundant transcripts common to tester and driver escaped subtraction.
	{N}onetheless, the four libraries were greatly enriched in clones
	encoding for very rare (0.0005\% of m{RNA}s) tester-specific transcripts.
	{CONCLUSIONS}: {T}he close agreement between our hybridization and
	sequencing results shows that the addition and follow-up of exogenous
	reporter transcripts provides an easy and reliable means to check
	{SSH} performance. {D}espite some cases of irregular normalisation
	and subtraction failure, we have shown that {SSH} repeatedly enriches
	the libraries in very rare, tester-specific transcripts, and can
	thus be considered as a powerful tool to investigate situations where
	small amounts of biological material are available, such as during
	early mammalian development.},

	targets for translational regulation is challenging, since the interaction

	{M}oving{T}argets to identify a high-likelihood set of 83 mi{RNA}

	{T}he task of feature selection is crucial given the presence of

	an optimal subset of 14 representative features, which were all related

	{T}he profiled {SVM} produced the best results (r=0.44, {ME} = 0.022,

	evolve primarily through tandem duplication and high rates of birth
	and death in clusters, and others through infrequent polyploidy or
	large-scale segmental duplications and subsequent losses. {RESULTS}:
	{O}ur approach to understanding the mechanisms of gene family evolution
	was to construct phylogenies for 50 large gene families in {A}rabidopsis
	thaliana, identify large internal segmental duplications in {A}rabidopsis,
	map gene duplications onto the segmental duplications, and use this
	information to identify which nodes in each phylogeny arose due to

	evaluate contributions of tandem duplication and segmental genome
	duplication in the generation and maintenance of gene families. {T}hese

	of genomic compositional inhomogeneities and disuniformities. {I}dentifying
	specific tendencies or peculiar deviations in the distributions of
	the effective occurrence frequencies of oligonucleotides, with respect
	to what can be a priori expected, is of the greatest importance in
	biology. {D}ifferences between expected and actual distributions
	may in fact suggest or confirm the existence of specific biological
	mechanisms related to them. {S}imilarly, a marked deviation in the
	occurrence frequency of an oligonucleotide may suggest that it belongs
	to the class of so-called "{DNA} signal (target) sequences". {T}he
	approach we have elaborated is innovative in various aspects. {F}irstly,
	the analysis of the genomic data is carried out in the light of the
	observation that the distribution of the four nucleotides along the
	coding regions of the genoma is biased by the existence of a well-defined
	"reading frame". {S}econdly, the "experimental" numbers found by
	counting the occurrences of the various oligonucleotide sequences
	are appropriately corrected for the many kinds of mistakes and redundancies
	present in the available genetic {D}ata {B}ases. {A} methodologically
	significant further improvement of our approach over the existing
	searching strategies is represented by the fact that, in order to
	decide whether or not the (corrected) "experimental" value of the
	occurrence frequency of a given oligonucleotide is within statistical
	expectations, a measure of the strength of the selective pressure,
	having acted on it in the course of the evolution, is assigned to
	the sequence, in a way that takes into account both the value of
	the "experimental" occurrence frequency of the sequence and the magnitude
	of the probability that this number might be the result of statistical
	fluctuations. {I}f the strength of the selective pressure evaluated
	in this fashion turns out to be sufficiently large, the corresponding

	{T}here is now compelling evidence that secondary {DNA} is functional,
	i.e. positively selected by organismal selection, not the purely
	neutral or 'selfish' outcome of mutation pressure. {T}he skeletal
	{DNA} theory argued that nuclear volumes are genetically determined
	primarily by nuclear {DNA} amounts, modulated somewhat by genes affecting
	the degree of {DNA} packing or unfolding; the huge spread of nuclear
	genome sizes is the necessary consequence of the origin of the nuclear
	envelope and the nucleation of its assembly by {DNA}, plus the adaptively
	significant 300 000-fold range of cell volumes and selection for
	balanced growth by optimizing karyoplasmic volume ratios (essentially
	invariant with cell volume in growing/multiplying cells). {T}his
	simple explanation of the {C}-value paradox is refined here in the
	light of new insights into the nature of heterochromatin and the
	nuclear lamina, the genetic control of cell volume, and large-scale
	eukaryote phylogeny, placing special emphasis on protist test cases
	of the basic principles of nuclear genome size evolution. {GENOME}
	{MINIATURIZATION}: and {E}xpansion {I}ntracellular parasites (e.g.
	{P}lasmodium, microsporidia) dwarfed their genomes by gene loss and
	eliminating virtually all secondary {DNA}. {T}he primary driving
	forces for genome reduction are metabolic and spatial economy and
	cell multiplication speed. {M}ost extreme nuclear shrinkage yielded
	genomes as tiny as 0.38 {M}b (making the nuclear genome size range
	effectively 1.8 million-fold!) in some minute enslaved nuclei (nucleomorphs)
	of cryptomonads and chlorarachneans, chimaeric cells that also retain
	a separate normal large nucleus. {T}he latter shows typical correlation
	between genome size and cell volume, but nucleomorphs do not despite
	co-existing in the same cell for >500 {M}y. {T}hus mutation pressure
	does not inexorably increase genome size; selection can eliminate
	essentially all non-coding {DNA} if need be. {N}ucleomorphs and microsporidia
	even reduced gene size. {E}xpansion of secondary {DNA} in the main
	nucleus, and in large-celled eukaryotes generally, must be positively

	test that refutes the selfish {DNA} and strongly supports the skeletal
	{DNA}/karyoplasmic ratio interpretation of genome size evolution.

  abstract = {A revised six-kingdom system of life is presented, down to the level
	of infraphylum. {A}s in my 1983 system {B}acteria are treated as
	a single kingdom, and eukaryotes are divided into only five kingdoms:
	{P}rotozoa, {A}nimalia, {F}ungi, {P}lantae and {C}hromista. {I}ntermediate
	high level categories (superkingdom, subkingdom, branch, infrakingdom,
	superphylum, subphylum and infraphylum) are extensively used to avoid
	splitting organisms into an excessive number of kingdoms and phyla
	(60 only being recognized). {T}he two 'zoological' kingdoms, {P}rotozoa
	and {A}nimalia, are subject to the {I}nternational {C}ode of {Z}oological
	{N}omenclature, the kingdom {B}acteria to the {I}nternational {C}ode
	of {B}acteriological {N}omenclature, and the three 'botanical' kingdoms
	({P}lantae, {F}ungi, {C}hromista) to the {I}nternational {C}ode of
	{B}otanical {N}omenclature. {C}ircumscriptions of the kingdoms {B}acteria
	and {P}lantae remain unchanged since {C}avalier-{S}mith (1981). {T}he
	kingdom {F}ungi is expanded by adding {M}icrosporidia, because of
	protein sequence evidence that these amitochondrial intracellular
	parasites are related to conventional {F}ungi, not {P}rotozoa. {F}ungi
	are subdivided into four phyla and 20 classes; fungal classification
	at the rank of subclass and above is comprehensively revised. {T}he
	kingdoms {P}rotozoa and {A}nimalia are modified in the light of molecular
	phylogenetic evidence that {M}yxozoa are actually {A}nimalia, not
	{P}rotozoa, and that mesozoans are related to bilaterian animals.
	{A}nimalia are divided into four subkingdoms: {R}adiata (phyla {P}orifera,
	{C}nidaria, {P}lacozoa, {C}tenophora), {M}yxozoa, {M}esozoa and {B}ilateria
	(bilateral animals: all other phyla). {S}everal new higher level
	groupings are made in the animal kingdom including three new phyla:
	{A}canthognatha (rotifers, acanthocephalans, gastrotrichs, gnathostomulids),
	{B}rachiozoa (brachiopods and phoronids) and {L}obopoda (onychophorans
	and tardigrades), so only 23 animal phyla are recognized. {A}rchezoa,
	here restricted to the phyla {M}etamonada and {T}richozoa, are treated
	as a subkingdom within {P}rotozoa, as in my 1983 six-kingdom system,
	not as a separate kingdom. {T}he recently revised phylum {R}hizopoda
	is modified further by adding more flagellates and removing some
	'rhizopods' and is therefore renamed {C}ercozoa. {T}he number of
	protozoan phyla is reduced by grouping {M}ycetozoa and {A}rchamoebae
	(both now infraphyla) as a new subphylum {C}onosa within the phylum
	{A}moebozoa alongside the subphylum {L}obosa, which now includes
	both the traditional aerobic lobosean amoebae and {M}ulticilia. {H}aplosporidia
	and the (formerly microsporidian) metchnikovellids are now both placed
	within the phylum {S}porozoa. {T}hese changes make a total of only
	13 currently recognized protozoan phyla, which are grouped into two
	subkingdoms: {A}rchezoa and {N}eozoa the latter is modified in circumscription
	by adding the {D}iscicristata, a new infrakingdom comprising the
	phyla {P}ercolozoa and {E}uglenozoa). {T}hese changes are discussed
	in relation to the principles of megasystematics, here defined as
	systematics that concentrates on the higher levels of classes, phyla,
	and kingdoms. {T}hese principles also make it desirable to rank {A}rchaebacteria

  abstract = {The primary taxa of eukaryote classification should be monophyletic
	and based on fundamental cell structure rather than nutritional adaptive
	zones. {T}he classical two kingdom classification into "plants" and
	"animals" and the newer four kingdom classifications into "protis",
	"fungi" "animals" and "plants" are therefore both unsatisfactory.
	{E}ukaryotes can be classified into nine kingdoms each defined in
	terms of a unique constellation of cell structures. {F}ive kingdoms
	have plate-like mitochondrial cristae: (1) {E}ufungi (the non-ciliated
	fungi, which unlike the other eight kingdoms have unstacked {G}olgi
	cisternae), (2) {C}iliofungi (the posteriorly ciliated fungi), (3)
	{A}nimalia ({A}nimals, sponges, mesozoa, and choanociliates; phagotrophs
	with basically posterior ciliation), (4) {B}iliphyta ({N}on-phagotrophic,
	phycobilisome-containing, algae; i.e. the{G}laucophyceae and {R}hodophyceae),
	(5) {V}iridiplantae ({N}on-phagotrophic green plants, with starch-containing
	plastids). {K}ingdom (6), the {E}uglenozoa, has disc-shaped cristae
	and an intraciliary dense rod and may be phagotrophic and/or phototrophic
	with plastids with three-membraned envelopes. {K}ingdom (7), the
	cryptophyta, has flattened tubular cristae, tubular mastigonemes
	on both cilia,m and starch in thecompartment between the plastid
	endoplasmic reticulum and the plastid envelope; their plastids, if
	present, have phycobilins inside the paired thylakoids and chlorophyll
	c2. {K}ingdom (8), the {C}hromophyta, has tubular cristae, together
	with tubular mastigonemes on one anterior cilum and/or a plastid
	endoplasmic reticulum and chlorophyll c1 + c2. {M}embers of the ninth
	kingdom, the {P}rotozoa, are mainly phagotrophic, and have tubular
	or vesicular cristae (or lack mitochondria altogether), and lack
	tubular mastigonemes on their (primitively anterior) cilia; plastids
	if present have three-envelop membranes, chlorophyll c2, and no internal
	starch, and a plastid endoplasmic reticulum is absent. {K}ingdoms
	4-9 are primitively anteriorly biciliate. {D}etailed definitions
	of the new kingdoms and lists of the phyla comprising them are given.
	{A}dvantages of the new system and its main phylogenetic implications
	are discussed. {A} simpler system of five kingdoms suitable for very
	elementary teaching is possible by grouping the photosynthetic and
	fungal kindoms in pairs. {V}arious compromises are possible between
	the nine and five kingdoms systems; it is suggested that the best
	one for general scientific use is a system of seven kingdoms in which
	the {E}ufungi and {C}iliofungi become subkingdoms of the {K}ingdom
	{F}ungi, and the {C}ryptophyta and{C}hromophyta subkingdoms of th
	{K}ingdom {C}hromista; the {F}ungi, {V}iridiplantae, {B}iliphyta,
	and {C}hromista can be subject to the {B}otanical {C}ode of {N}omenclature,

  volume = {2},
  pages = {e383},
  number = {4},
  abstract = {Orthology detection is critically important for accurate functional
	annotation, and has been widely used to facilitate studies on comparative
	and evolutionary genomics. Although various methods are now available,
	there has been no comprehensive analysis of performance, due to the
	lack of a genomic-scale 'gold standard' orthology dataset. Even in
	the absence of such datasets, the comparison of results from alternative
	methodologies contains useful information, as agreement enhances
	confidence and disagreement indicates possible errors. Latent Class
	Analysis (LCA) is a statistical technique that can exploit this information
	to reasonably infer sensitivities and specificities, and is applied
	here to evaluate the performance of various orthology detection methods
	on a eukaryotic dataset. Overall, we observe a trade-off between
	sensitivity and specificity in orthology detection, with BLAST-based
	methods characterized by high sensitivity, and tree-based methods
	by high specificity. Two algorithms exhibit the best overall balance,
	with both sensitivity and specificity>80\%: INPARANOID identifies
	orthologs across two species while OrthoMCL clusters orthologs from
	multiple species. Among methods that permit clustering of ortholog
	groups spanning multiple genomes, the (automated) OrthoMCL algorithm
	exhibits better within-group consistency with respect to protein
	function and domain architecture than the (manually curated) KOG
	database, and the homolog clustering algorithm TribeMCL as well.
	By way of using LCA, we are also able to comprehensively assess similarities
	and statistical dependence between various strategies, and evaluate
	the effects of parameter settings on performance. In summary, we
	present a comprehensive evaluation of orthology detection on a divergent
	set of eukaryotic genomes, thus providing insights and guides for
	method selection, tuning and development for different applications.
	Many biological questions have been addressed by multiple tests yielding
	binary (yes/no) outcomes but no clear definition of truth, making
	LCA an attractive approach for computational biology.},

	known and putative {A}rabidopsis transcription factors. {T}he m{RNA}
	levels of 402 distinct transcription factor genes were examined at
	different developmental stages and under various stress conditions.
	{T}ranscription factors potentially controlling downstream gene expression
	in stress signal transduction pathways were identified by observed
	activation and repression of the genes after certain stress treatments.
	{T}he m{RNA} levels of a number of previously characterized transcription
	factor genes were changed significantly in connection with other

	expression of 74 transcription factor genes responsive to bacterial
	pathogen infection was reduced or abolished in mutants that have
	defects in salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, or ethylene signaling.
	{T}his observation indicates that the regulation of these genes is
	mediated at least partly by these plant hormones and suggests that
	the transcription factor genes are involved in the regulation of
	additional downstream responses mediated by these hormones. {A}mong
	the 43 transcription factor genes that are induced during senescence,
	28 of them also are induced by stress treatment, suggesting extensive

	an efficient biclustering algorithm and parallel coordinate visualization.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {9},
  pages = {210},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The DNA microarray technology allows the measurement of
	expression levels of thousands of genes under tens/hundreds of different
	conditions. In microarray data, genes with similar functions usually
	co-express under certain conditions only 1. Thus, biclustering which
	clusters genes and conditions simultaneously is preferred over the
	traditional clustering technique in discovering these coherent genes.
	Various biclustering algorithms have been developed using different
	bicluster formulations. Unfortunately, many useful formulations result
	in NP-complete problems. In this article, we investigate an efficient
	method for identifying a popular type of biclusters called additive
	model. Furthermore, parallel coordinate (PC) plots are used for bicluster
	visualization and analysis. RESULTS: We develop a novel and efficient
	biclustering algorithm which can be regarded as a greedy version
	of an existing algorithm known as pCluster algorithm. By relaxing
	the constraint in homogeneity, the proposed algorithm has polynomial-time
	complexity in the worst case instead of exponential-time complexity
	as in the pCluster algorithm. Experiments on artificial datasets
	verify that our algorithm can identify both additive-related and
	multiplicative-related biclusters in the presence of overlap and
	noise. Biologically significant biclusters have been validated on
	the yeast cell-cycle expression dataset using Gene Ontology annotations.
	Comparative study shows that the proposed approach outperforms several
	existing biclustering algorithms. We also provide an interactive
	exploratory tool based on PC plot visualization for determining the
	parameters of our biclustering algorithm. CONCLUSION: We have proposed
	a novel biclustering algorithm which works with PC plots for an interactive
	exploratory analysis of gene expression data. Experiments show that
	the biclustering algorithm is efficient and is capable of detecting
	co-regulated genes. The interactive analysis enables an optimum parameter
	determination in the biclustering algorithm so as to achieve the
	best result. In future, we will modify the proposed algorithm for
	other bicluster models such as the coherent evolution model.},

  abstract = {Diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) convert diacylglycerol (DAG) into phosphatidic
	acid (PA), acting as molecular switches between DAG- and PA-mediated
	signaling. We previously showed that Src-dependent activation and
	plasma membrane recruitment of DGKalpha are required for growth-factor-induced
	cell migration and ruffling, through the control of Rac small-GTPase
	activation and plasma membrane localization. Herein we unveil a signaling
	pathway through which DGKalpha coordinates the localization of Rac.
	We show that upon hepatocyte growth-factor stimulation, DGKalpha,
	by producing PA, provides a key signal to recruit atypical PKCzeta/iota
	(aPKCzeta/iota) in complex with RhoGDI and Rac at ruffling sites
	of colony-growing epithelial cells. Then, DGKalpha-dependent activation
	of aPKCzeta/iota mediates the release of Rac from the inhibitory
	complex with RhoGDI, allowing its activation and leading to formation
	of membrane ruffles, which constitute essential requirements for
	cell migration. These findings highlight DGKalpha as the central
	element of a lipid signaling pathway linking tyrosine kinase growth-factor
	receptors to regulation of aPKCs and RhoGDI, and providing a positional
	signal regulating Rac association to the plasma membrane.},

	conserved sequences (often known as phylogenetic footprinting) has
	identified individual transcription factor binding sites. {W}e extend
	this concept of functional conservation to higher-order features
	of transcription control regions. {RESULTS}: {W}e used the genome
	sequences of four yeast species of the genus {S}accharomyces to identify
	sequences potentially involved in multifactorial control of gene
	expression. {W}e found 989 potential regulatory 'templates': pairs
	of hexameric sequences that are jointly conserved in transcription
	regulatory regions and also exhibit non-random relative spacing.
	{M}any of the individual sequences in these templates correspond
	to known transcription factor binding sites, and the sets of genes
	containing a particular template in their transcription control regions
	tend to be differentially expressed in conditions where the corresponding
	transcription factors are known to be active. {T}he incorporation
	of word pairs to define sequence features yields more specific predictions

	(in 4 hours) and from 20.3 +/- 7.2\% to 72.2 +/- 5\% (in 5 hours).
	Other indices of functional recovery showed similar improved performance
	with the significant decrease in time from the onset of reperfusion
	to the return of regular sinus rhythm (57 +/- 8 v 495 +/- 150 s).
	The efflux of lactate during 5 hr ischaemic arrest was decreased
	(20.62 +/- 1.3 v 26.18 +/- 1.73 mumol/heart for oxygenated STH and
	STH, respectively, p < 0.05) and the progressive increase in the
	coronary vascular resistance was abolished in the oxygenated STH
	treated hearts. These improvements were associated with the reduction
	in the decline of the myocardial adenosine triphosphate (14.49 +/-
	2 v 3.3 +/- 0.19 mumol/g dry wt), creatine phosphate (24.61 +/- 3.47
	v 7.48 +/- 1.34 mumol/g dry wt) and guanosine triphosphate (1.69
	+/- 0.2 v 0.84 +/- 0.08 mumol/g dry wt) during ischaemia, total resynthesis
	after reperfusion (ATP: 103\% v 36\%, CP: 105\% v 69\% and GTP: 203\%
	v 61\% of control) and the total absence of myocardial cells and
	microvasculature injuries in ischaemic (non-reperfused) hearts. These
	results confirm that the provision of additional oxygen to the St.
	Thomas' Hospital solution (with 95\% O2:5\% CO2) can meet the metabolic
	demand of the ischaemic myocardium and thus increase the safe duration

  abstract = {It has sometimes been suggested that the term adaptation should be
	reserved for differences with a known genetic basis. We argue that
	adaptation should be defined by its effects rather than by its causes
	as any difference between two phenotypic traits (or trait complexes)
	which increases the inclusive fitness of its carrier. This definition
	implies that some adaptations may arise by means other than natural
	selection. It is particularly important to bear this in mind when
	behavioural traits are considered. Critics of the 'adaptationist
	programme' have suggested that an important objection to many adaptive
	explanations is that they rely on ad-hoc arguments concerning the
	function of previously observed differences. We suggest that this
	is a less important problem (because evolutionary explanations generally
	claim some sort of generality and are therefore testable) than the
	difficulties arising from confounding variables. These are more widespread
	and more subtle than is generally appreciated. Not all differences
	between organisms are directly adapted to ecological variation. The
	form of particular traits usually constrains the form of value that
	other traits can take, presenting several obstacles to attempts to
	relate variation in morphological or behavioural characteristics
	directly to environmental differences. We describe some of the repercussions
	of differences in body size among vertebrates and ways in which these
	can be allowed for. In addition, a variety of evolutionary processes
	can produce non-adaptive differences between organisms. One way of
	distinguishing between these and adaptations is to investigate adaptive
	trends in phylogenetically different groups of species.},

	and management of a life-threatening syndrome (high fever, altered
	mental status, profound muscular rigidity that sometimes progressed
	to fatal rhabdomyolysis) in patients who experience the abrupt withdrawal
	of intrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective literature
	and safety-file review. SETTING: Expert panel drawn from physiatry,
	neurology, and neurosurgery. PARTICIPANTS: Experienced users of ITB
	therapy in the pediatric and adult populations in the United States.
	INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We reviewed
	literature reports, MedWatch reports to the US Food and Drug Administration,
	and our own experiences. We critically analyzed patient management
	and drug therapy in the context of the pharmacology of baclofen and
	other antispastic agents. RESULTS: An abrupt reduction in gamma-aminobutyric
	acid(B) (GABA) agonist activity in the central nervous system can
	cause the ITB withdrawal syndrome, which is clinically and pathophysiologically
	distinct from autonomic dysreflexia, malignant hyperthermia, and
	neuroleptic-malignant syndrome. ITB withdrawal evolves over 1 to
	3 days, but may become fulminant if not recognized and treated early.
	The syndrome can be interrupted by the restoration of ITB therapy.
	However, supportive measures and high-dose benzodiazepine infusion
	may be life saving in the interval before ITB therapy is resumed.
	Dantrolene infusion may relieve muscle rigidity but does not reverse
	the other manifestations of GABAergic agonist withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS:
	Most episodes of severe ITB withdrawal were preventable. Patients
	at risk can be identified and educated prospectively and given medication
	for emergency use. Treatment with GABAergic agonist drugs may prevent
	potentially fatal sequelae.},

  number = {6},
  abstract = {B{ACKGROUND}: {A}mong three sources of evolutionary innovation in
	gene function - point mutations, gene duplications, and gene shuffling
	(recombination between dissimilar genes) - gene shuffling is the
	most potent one. {H}owever, surprisingly little is known about its
	incidence on a genome-wide scale. {RESULTS}: {W}e have studied shuffling
	in genes that are conserved between distantly related species. {S}pecifically,
	we estimated the incidence of gene shuffling in ten organisms from
	the three domains of life: eukaryotes, eubacteria, and archaea, considering
	only genes showing significant sequence similarity in pairwise genome
	comparisons. {W}e found that successful gene shuffling is very rare
	among such conserved genes. {F}or example, we could detect only 48
	successful gene-shuffling events in the genome of the fruit fly {D}rosophila
	melanogaster which have occurred since its common ancestor with the
	worm {C}aenorhabditis elegans more than half a billion years ago.
	{CONCLUSION}: {T}he incidence of gene shuffling is roughly an order
	of magnitude smaller than the incidence of single-gene duplication
	in eukaryotes, but it can approach or even exceed the gene-duplication
	rate in prokaryotes. {I}f true in general, this pattern suggests
	that gene shuffling may not be a major force in reshaping the core
	genomes of eukaryotes. {O}ur results also cast doubt on the notion
	that introns facilitate gene shuffling, both because prokaryotes
	show an appreciable incidence of gene shuffling despite their lack
	of introns and because we find no statistical association between
	exon-intron boundaries and recombined domains in the two multicellular
	genomes we studied.},

	{H}ere we performed a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of b{ZIP}
	genes from algae, mosses, ferns, gymnosperms and angiosperms. {METHODOLOGY}/{PRINCIPAL}
	{FINDINGS}: {W}e identified 13 groups of b{ZIP} homologues in angiosperms,
	three more than known before, that represent 34 {P}ossible {G}roups
	of {O}rthologues ({P}o{GO}s). {T}he 34 {P}o{GO}s may correspond to
	the complete set of ancestral angiosperm b{ZIP} genes that participated
	in the diversification of flowering plants. {H}omologous genes dedicated
	to seed-related processes and {ABA}-mediated stress responses originated
	in the common ancestor of seed plants, and three groups of homologues
	emerged in the angiosperm lineage, of which one group plays a role
	in optimizing the use of energy. {CONCLUSIONS}/{SIGNIFICANCE}: {O}ur
	data suggest that the ancestor of green plants possessed four b{ZIP}
	genes functionally involved in oxidative stress and unfolded protein
	responses that are b{ZIP}-mediated processes in all eukaryotes, but
	also in light-dependent regulations. {T}he four founder genes amplified
	and diverged significantly, generating traits that benefited the

  abstract = {In skeletal muscle, calcineurin is crucial for myocyte differentiation
	and in the determination of the slow oxidative fibre phenotype, both
	processes being important determinants of muscle performance, metabolic
	health and meat-animal production. Fibre type is defined by the isoform
	identity of the skeletal myosin heavy chain (MyHC). We have examined
	the responses of the major MyHC genes to calcineurin signalling during
	fibre formation of muscle C2C12 cells. We have found that calcineurin
	acts as a signal to up-regulate the fast-oxidative MyHC2a gene and
	to down-regulate the faster MyHC2x and MyHC2b genes in a manner that
	appears to be NFAT-independent. Contrary to expectation, the up-regulation
	of MyHCslow by calcineurin seems to be time-dependent and is only
	detectable once the initial differential expression of the post-natal
	fast MyHC genes has been established. The simultaneous elevated expression
	of MyHC2a and the repression of MyHC2x and MyHC2b expression indicate
	that both processes (elevation and repression) are actively coordinated
	during oxidative fibre conversion. We have further determined that
	muscle LIM protein (MLP), a calcineurin-binding Z-line co-factor,
	is induced by calcineurin and that its co-expression with calcineurin
	has an additive effect on MyHCslow expression. Hence, post-natal
	fast MyHCs are important early effector targets of calcineurin, whereas
	MyHCslow up-regulation is mediated in part by calcineurin-induced
	MLP.},

	{F}or an organism order is the distillation of regularities abstracted
	from observations. {A}n organism's very form is a functional manifestation
	of its ancestor's evolutionary and its own developmental memory.
	{A} completely ordered universe, however, would be dead. {C}haos
	is necessary for life. {B}ehavioral diversity, to take an example,
	is fundamental to an organism's survival. {N}o natural environment
	can be modeled in its entirety. {A}pproximation becomes essential
	to any system with finite resources. {C}haos, as we now understand
	it, is the dynamical mechanism by which nature develops constrained
	and useful randomness. {A}nd from it follow diversity and the ability
	to anticipate the uncertain future. {T}here is a tendency, whose
	laws we dimly comprehend, for natural systems to balance order and
	chaos, to move to the interface between structure and uncertainty.
	{T}he result is increased complexity. {T}his often appears as a change
	in a system's computational capability. {T}he present state of evolutionary
	progress suggests that one need go even further and postulate a force
	that drives in time toward successively more sophisticated and qualitatively
	different computation. {W}e can look back to times in which there
	were no systems that attempted to model themselves, as we do now.
	{T}his is certainly one of the outstanding puzzles: how can lifeless
	and disorganized matter exhibit such a drive? {A}nd the question
	goes to the heart of many disciplines, ranging from philosophy and
	cognitive science to evolutionary and developmental biology and particle
	astrophysics. {T}he dynamics of chaos, the appearance of pattern

  abstract = {M{OTIVATION}: {S}tatistical tests for the detection of differentially

	gene comparison. {W}ithout any further adjustment, these p-values
	may lead to a large number of false positives, simply because the
	number of genes to be tested is huge, which might mean wastage of
	laboratory resources. {T}o account for multiple hypotheses, these
	p-values are typically adjusted using a single step method or a step-down
	method in order to achieve an overall control of the error rate (the
	so-called familywise error rate). {I}n many applications, this may
	lead to an overly conservative strategy leading to too few genes
	being flagged. {RESULTS}: {I}n this paper we introduce a novel empirical
	{B}ayes screening ({EBS}) technique to inspect a large number of
	p-values in an effort to detect additional positive cases. {I}n effect,
	each case borrows strength from an overall picture of the alternative
	hypotheses computed from all the p-values, while the entire procedure
	is calibrated by a step-down method so that the familywise error
	rate at the complete null hypothesis is still controlled. {I}t is
	shown that the {EBS} has substantially higher sensitivity than the
	standard step-down approach for multiple comparison at the cost of
	a modest increase in the false discovery rate ({FDR}). {T}he {EBS}
	procedure also compares favorably when compared with existing {FDR}
	control procedures for multiple testing. {T}he {EBS} procedure is
	particularly useful in situations where it is important to identify
	all possible potentially positive cases which can be subjected to
	further confirmatory testing in order to eliminate the false positives.
	{W}e illustrated this screening procedure using a data set on human
	colorectal cancer where we show that the {EBS} method detected additional
	genes related to colon cancer that were missed by other methods.{T}his
	novel empirical {B}ayes procedure is advantageous over our earlier
	proposed empirical {B}ayes adjustments due to the following reasons:
	(i) it offers an automatic screening of the p-values the user may
	obtain from a univariate (i.e., gene by gene) analysis package making
	it extremely easy to use for a non-statistician, (ii) since it applies
	to the p-values, the tests do not have to be t-tests; in particular
	they could be {F}-tests which might arise in certain {ANOVA} formulations
	with expression data or even nonparametric tests, (iii) the empirical
	{B}ayes adjustment uses nonparametric function estimation techniques
	to estimate the marginal density of the transformed p-values rather
	than using a parametric model for the prior distribution and is therefore
	robust against model mis-specification. {AVAILABILITY}: {R} code

	{I}n the context of the clustering of genes with similar patterns

	to extend commonly used linear measures. {S}ince mutual information
	is defined in terms of discrete variables, its application to continuous

	{I}n this work, we propose a method for the numerical estimation

	{T}he determination of the regulatory circuits controlled by each

	promoter sequences, transcription factors and their target genes.
	{AGRIS} currently contains two databases, {A}t{TFDB} ({A}rabidopsis
	thaliana transcription factor database) and {A}tcis{DB} ({A}rabidopsis
	thaliana cis-regulatory database). {A}t{TFDB} contains information

	of the transcription factors with available mutants and, when known,
	with the possible genes they may regulate. {A}tcis{DB} consists of
	the 5' regulatory sequences of all 29,388 annotated genes with a
	description of the corresponding cis-regulatory elements. {U}sers
	can search the databases for (i) promoter sequences, (ii) a transcription

	It is primarily designed for biologists with no experience in phylogeny,

	three main modes. The 'One Click' mode targets non-specialists and
	provides a ready-to-use pipeline chaining programs with recognized
	accuracy and speed: MUSCLE for multiple alignment, PhyML for tree
	building, and TreeDyn for tree rendering. All parameters are set
	up to suit most studies, and users only have to provide their input
	sequences to obtain a ready-to-print tree. The 'Advanced' mode uses
	the same pipeline but allows the parameters of each program to be
	customized by users. The 'A la Carte' mode offers more flexibility
	and sophistication, as users can build their own pipeline by selecting
	and setting up the required steps from a large choice of tools to
	suit their specific needs. Prior to phylogenetic analysis, users
	can also collect neighbors of a query sequence by running BLAST on
	general or specialized databases. A guide tree then helps to select

	{O}streococcus tauri ({P}rasinophyceae). {T}his cosmopolitan marine
	primary producer is the world's smallest free-living eukaryote known
	to date. {F}eatures likely reflecting optimization of environmentally
	relevant pathways, including resource acquisition, unusual photosynthesis
	apparatus, and genes potentially involved in {C}(4) photosynthesis,
	were observed, as was downsizing of many gene families. {O}verall,
	the 12.56-{M}b nuclear genome has an extremely high gene density,
	in part because of extensive reduction of intergenic regions and
	other forms of compaction such as gene fusion. {H}owever, the genome
	is structurally complex. {I}t exhibits previously unobserved levels
	of heterogeneity for a eukaryote. {T}wo chromosomes differ structurally
	from the other eighteen. {B}oth have a significantly biased {G}+{C}
	content, and, remarkably, they contain the majority of transposable
	elements. {M}any chromosome 2 genes also have unique codon usage
	and splicing, but phylogenetic analysis and composition do not support
	alien gene origin. {I}n contrast, most chromosome 19 genes show no
	similarity to green lineage genes and a large number of them are
	specialized in cell surface processes. {T}aken together, the complete
	genome sequence, unusual features, and downsized gene families, make
	{O}. tauri an ideal model system for research on eukaryotic genome

	offer a paradigm for studying such issues, because in multicellular

	are extensively used in fundamental developmental processes and are
	highly diversified. {A} number of large eukaryote lineages are exclusively

	such as the {HD} proteins. {T}aking advantage from the recent burst
	of sequence data from a wide variety of eukaryote taxa, we show here
	that {HD}-containing transcription factors were already existing

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {10 Suppl 1},
  pages = {S27},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biclustering algorithms belong to a distinct class of
	clustering algorithms that perform simultaneous clustering of both
	rows and columns of the gene expression matrix and can be a very
	useful analysis tool when some genes have multiple functions and
	experimental conditions are diverse. Cheng and Church have introduced
	a measure called mean squared residue score to evaluate the quality
	of a bicluster and has become one of the most popular measures to
	search for biclusters. In this paper, we review basic concepts of
	the metaheuristics Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP)-construction
	and local search phases and propose a new method which is a variant
	of GRASP called Reactive Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure
	(Reactive GRASP) to detect significant biclusters from large microarray
	datasets. The method has two major steps. First, high quality bicluster
	seeds are generated by means of k-means clustering. In the second
	step, these seeds are grown using the Reactive GRASP, in which the
	basic parameter that defines the restrictiveness of the candidate
	list is self-adjusted, depending on the quality of the solutions
	found previously. RESULTS: We performed statistical and biological
	validations of the biclusters obtained and evaluated the method against
	the results of basic GRASP and as well as with the classic work of
	Cheng and Church. The experimental results indicate that the Reactive
	GRASP approach outperforms the basic GRASP algorithm and Cheng and
	Church approach. CONCLUSION: The Reactive GRASP approach for the
	detection of significant biclusters is robust and does not require
	calibration efforts.},

  abstract = {There are many algorithms to cluster sample data points based on nearness
	or a similarity measure. {O}ften the implication is that points in
	different clusters come from different underlying classes, whereas
	those in the same cluster come from the same class. {S}tochastically,
	the underlying classes represent different random processes. {T}he
	inference is that clusters represent a partition of the sample points
	according to which process they belong. {T}his paper discusses a
	model-based clustering toolbox that evaluates cluster accuracy. {E}ach
	random process is modeled as its mean plus independent noise, sample
	points are generated, the points are clustered, and the clustering
	error is the number of points clustered incorrectly according to
	the generating random processes. {V}arious clustering algorithms
	are evaluated based on process variance and the key issue of the
	rate at which algorithmic performance improves with increasing numbers
	of experimental replications. {T}he model means can be selected by
	hand to test the separability of expected types of biological expression
	patterns. {A}lternatively, the model can be seeded by real data to
	test the expected precision of that output or the extent of improvement
	in precision that replication could provide. {I}n the latter case,
	a clustering algorithm is used to form clusters, and the model is
	seeded with the means and variances of these clusters. {O}ther algorithms
	are then tested relative to the seeding algorithm. {R}esults are
	averaged over various seeds. {O}utput includes error tables and graphs,
	confusion matrices, principal-component plots, and validation measures.
	{F}ive algorithms are studied in detail: {K}-means, fuzzy {C}-means,

	regions are more likely to contain functional elements than less-conserved
	portions of the genome. {METHODS}: {H}ere we used a motif-oriented
	machine learning method based on the {R}elevance {V}ector {M}achine
	algorithm to extract the strongest signal from a set of non-coding
	conserved sequences. {RESULTS}: {W}e successfully fitted models to

	carteri to identify additional genes with the potential to encode
	{VARL} domain proteins. {H}ere we report that the {VARL} gene family,
	which consists of 12 members in {C}. reinhardtii and 14 in {V}. carteri,
	has experienced a complex evolutionary history in which members of
	the family have been both gained and lost over time, although several
	pairs of potentially orthologous genes can still be identified. {W}e
	find that reg{A} is part of a tandem array of four {VARL} genes in
	{V}. carteri but that a similar array is absent in {C}. reinhardtii.
	{M}ost importantly, our phylogenetic analysis suggests that a proto-reg{A}
	gene was present in a common unicellular ancestor of {V}. carteri
	and {C}. reinhardtii and that this gene was lost in the latter lineage.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Overlapping sense/antisense genes orientated in a tail-to-tail
	manner, often involving only the 3'UTRs, form the majority of gene
	pairs in mammalian genomes and can lead to the formation of double-stranded
	RNA that triggers the destruction of homologous mRNAs. Overlapping
	polyadenylation signal sequences have not been described previously.
	RESULTS: An instance of gene overlap has been found involving a shared
	single functional polyadenylation site. The genes involved are the
	human alpha/beta hydrolase domain containing gene 1 (ABHD1) and Sec12
	genes. The nine exon human ABHD1 gene is located on chromosome 2p23.3
	and encodes a 405-residue protein containing a catalytic triad analogous
	to that present in serine proteases. The Sec12 protein promotes efficient
	guanine nucleotide exchange on the Sar1 GTPase in the ER. Their sequences
	overlap for 42 bp in the 3'UTR in an antisense manner. Analysis by
	3' RACE identified a single functional polyadenylation site, ATTAAA,
	within the 3'UTR of ABHD1 and a single polyadenylation signal, AATAAA,
	within the 3'UTR of Sec12. These polyadenylation signals overlap,
	sharing three bp. They are also conserved in mouse and rat. ABHD1
	was expressed in all tissues and cells examined, but levels of ABHD1
	varied greatly, being high in skeletal muscle and testis and low
	in spleen and fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Mammalian ABHD1 and Sec12
	genes contain a conserved 42 bp overlap in their 3'UTR, and share
	a conserved TTTATTAAA/TTTAATAAA sequence that serves as a polyadenylation
	signal for both genes. No inverse correlation between the respective
	levels of ABHD1 and Sec12 RNA was found to indicate that any RNA
	interference occurred.},

  pages = {19},
  month = {Jun},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In mammals, L-threonine is an indispensable amino acid.
	The conversion of L-threonine to glycine occurs through a two-step
	biochemical pathway involving the enzymes L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase
	and 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate coenzyme A ligase. The L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase
	enzyme has been purified and characterised, but the L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase
	gene has not previously been identified in mammals. RESULTS: Transcripts
	for L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase from both the mouse and pig are reported.
	The ORFs of both L-threonine dehydrogenase cDNAs encode proteins
	of 373 residues (41.5 kDa) and they share 80\% identity. The mouse
	gene is located on chromosome 14, band C. The amino-terminal regions
	of these proteins have characteristics of a mitochondrial targeting
	sequence and are related to the UDP-galactose 4-epimerases, with
	both enzyme families having an amino-terminal NAD+ binding domain.
	That these cDNAs encode threonine dehydrogenases was shown, previously,
	by tiling 13 tryptic peptide sequences, obtained from purified L-threonine
	dehydrogenase isolated from porcine liver mitochondria, on to the
	pig ORF. These eukaryotic L-threonine dehydrogenases also have significant
	similarity with the prokaryote L-threonine dehydrogenase amino-terminus
	peptide sequence of the bacterium, Clostridium sticklandii. In murine
	tissues, the expression of both L-threonine dehydrogenase and 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate
	coenzyme A ligase mRNAs were highest in the liver and were also present
	in brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, spleen and
	testis. CONCLUSIONS: The first cloning of transcripts for L-threonine
	dehydrogenase from eukaryotic organisms are reported. However, they
	do not have any significant sequence homology to the well-characterised
	Escherichia coli L-threonine dehydrogenase.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: To elucidate further the pathogenesis of sporadic, idiopathic
	pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) and identify potential therapeutic
	avenues, differential gene expression in IPAH was examined by suppression
	subtractive hybridisation (SSH). METHODS: Peripheral lung samples
	were obtained immediately after removal from patients undergoing
	lung transplant for IPAH without familial disease, and control tissues
	consisted of similarly sampled pieces of donor lungs not utilised
	during transplantation. Pools of lung mRNA from IPAH cases containing
	plexiform lesions and normal donor lungs were used to generate the
	tester and driver cDNA libraries, respectively. A subtracted IPAH
	cDNA library was made by SSH. Clones isolated from this subtracted
	library were examined for up regulated expression in IPAH using dot
	blot arrays of positive colony PCR products using both pooled cDNA
	libraries as probes. Clones verified as being upregulated were sequenced.
	For two genes the increase in expression was verified by northern
	blotting and data analysed using Student's unpaired two-tailed t-test.
	RESULTS: We present preliminary findings concerning candidate genes
	upregulated in IPAH. Twenty-seven upregulated genes were identified
	out of 192 clones examined. Upregulation in individual cases of IPAH
	was shown by northern blot for tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3
	and decorin (P < 0.01) compared with the housekeeping gene glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate
	dehydrogenase. CONCLUSION: Four of the up regulated genes, magic
	roundabout, hevin, thrombomodulin and sucrose non-fermenting protein-related
	kinase-1 are expressed specifically by endothelial cells and one,
	muscleblind-1, by muscle cells, suggesting that they may be associated

	related to blinded perceptual counts of the symptom frequency in

	A principle components analysis identified three factors that accounted
	for 95\% of the variance: the first factor included sentence and
	word duration, frequency shifts, and aperiodic instances; the second

	Finally, a multiple regression demonstrated that the acoustic measures

	most highly related and none of the other measures contributing once
	the effect of word duration was partialed out. The results indicate

	In this article, annotations of domain homology and secondary structure
	are used to define new measures of alignment quality and are used
	to make the first systematic, independent evaluation of these benchmarks.
	These measures indicate sensitivity and specificity while avoiding
	the ambiguous residue correspondences and arbitrary distance cutoffs
	inherent to structural superpositions. Alignments by selected methods
	that indicate high-confidence columns (ALIGN-M, DIALIGN-T, FSA and
	MUSCLE) are also assessed. Fold space coverage and effective benchmark
	database sizes are estimated by reference to domain annotations,
	and significant redundancy is found in all benchmarks except SABMARK.
	Questionable alignments are found in all benchmarks, especially in
	BALIBASE where 87\% of sequences have unknown structure, 20\% of
	columns contain different folds according to SUPERFAMILY and 30\%
	of 'core block' columns have conflicting secondary structure according
	to DSSP. A careful analysis of current protein multiple alignment
	benchmarks calls into question their ability to determine reliable
	algorithm rankings.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a previous paper, we introduced MUSCLE, a new program
	for creating multiple alignments of protein sequences, giving a brief
	summary of the algorithm and showing MUSCLE to achieve the highest
	scores reported to date on four alignment accuracy benchmarks. Here
	we present a more complete discussion of the algorithm, describing
	several previously unpublished techniques that improve biological
	accuracy and / or computational complexity. We introduce a new option,
	MUSCLE-fast, designed for high-throughput applications. We also describe
	a new protocol for evaluating objective functions that align two
	profiles. RESULTS: We compare the speed and accuracy of MUSCLE with
	CLUSTALW, Progressive POA and the MAFFT script FFTNS1, the fastest
	previously published program known to the author. Accuracy is measured
	using four benchmarks: BAliBASE, PREFAB, SABmark and SMART. We test
	three variants that offer highest accuracy (MUSCLE with default settings),
	highest speed (MUSCLE-fast), and a carefully chosen compromise between
	the two (MUSCLE-prog). We find MUSCLE-fast to be the fastest algorithm
	on all test sets, achieving average alignment accuracy similar to
	CLUSTALW in times that are typically two to three orders of magnitude
	less. MUSCLE-fast is able to align 1,000 sequences of average length
	282 in 21 seconds on a current desktop computer. CONCLUSIONS: MUSCLE
	offers a range of options that provide improved speed and / or alignment
	accuracy compared with currently available programs. MUSCLE is freely

	constructs a tree and a set of multiple sequence alignments, one

	contains all sequences within its sub-tree, and predicts which positions

	positions believed to be homologous across all sequences (e.g. profile
	{HMM} methods); by contrast {SATCHMO} makes different predictions

	{G}, {Y} = {C} or {U}, {N} = any base) of ancient {RNA}. {T}wo major
	questions were addressed in this paper. {F}irstly, the cause of {DNA}
	periodicity, which was investigated by comparisons between real and
	simulated coding sequences. {S}econdly, quantification of {DNA} periodicity
	was made using an evolutionary algorithm, which was not previously
	used for such purposes. {RESULTS}: {W}e have shown that simulated
	coding sequences, which were composed using codon usage frequencies
	only, demonstrate {DNA} periodicity very similar to the observed
	in real exons. {I}t was also found that {DNA} periodicity disappears
	in the simulated sequences, when the frequencies of codons become
	equal.{F}requencies of the nucleotides (and the dinucleotide {AG})
	at each location along phase 0 exons were calculated for {C}. elegans,
	{D}. melanogaster and {H}. sapiens. {T}wo models were used to fit
	these data, with the key objective of describing periodicity. {B}oth
	of the models showed that the best-fit curves closely matched the
	actual data points. {T}he first dynamic period determination model
	consistently generated a value, which was very close to the period
	equal to 3 nucleotides. {T}he second fixed period model, as expected,
	kept the period exactly equal to 3 and did not detract from its goodness
	of fit. {CONCLUSIONS}: {C}onclusion can be drawn that {DNA} periodicity
	in exons is determined by codon usage frequencies. {I}t is essential
	to differentiate between {DNA} periodicity itself, and the length
	of the period equal to 3. {P}eriodicity itself is a result of certain
	combinations of codons with different frequencies typical for a species.
	{T}he length of period equal to 3, instead, is caused by the triplet
	nature of genetic code. {T}he models and evolutionary algorithm used
	for characterising {DNA} periodicity are proven to be an effective
	tool for describing the periodicity pattern in a species, when a
	number of exons in the same phase are analysed.},

	the semicircle law is known to describe the spectral densities of
	uncorrelated random graphs, much less is known about the spectra
	of real-world graphs, describing such complex systems as the {I}nternet,
	metabolic pathways, networks of power stations, scientific collaborations,
	or movie actors, which are inherently correlated and usually very
	sparse. {A}n important limitation in addressing the spectra of these
	systems is that the numerical determination of the spectra for systems
	with more than a few thousand nodes is prohibitively time and memory
	consuming. {M}aking use of recent advances in algorithms for spectral
	characterization, here we develop methods to determine the eigenvalues
	of networks comparable in size to real systems, obtaining several
	surprising results on the spectra of adjacency matrices corresponding
	to models of real-world graphs. {W}e find that when the number of
	links grows as the number of nodes, the spectral density of uncorrelated
	random matrices does not converge to the semicircle law. {F}urthermore,
	the spectra of real-world graphs have specific features, depending
	on the details of the corresponding models. {I}n particular, scale-free
	graphs develop a trianglelike spectral density with a power-law tail,
	while small-world graphs have a complex spectral density consisting
	of several sharp peaks. {T}hese and further results indicate that
	the spectra of correlated graphs represent a practical tool for graph
	classification and can provide useful insight into the relevant structural

	{E}xperimental manipulation of gene activity coupled with the assessment
	of perturbed transcriptome (i. e., global m{RNA} expression) patterns
	represents one approach toward this goal, and may provide a backbone
	into which other measurements can be later integrated. {RESULT}:
	{W}e use microarray data on 287 single gene deletion {S}accharomyces
	cerevisiae mutant strains to elucidate generic relationships among
	perturbed transcriptomes. {T}heir comparison with a method that preferentially
	recognizes distinct expression subpatterns allows us to pair those
	transcriptomes that share localized similarities. {A}nalyses of the
	resulting transcriptome similarity network identify a continuum hierarchy
	among the deleted genes, and in the frequency of local similarities
	that establishes the links among their reorganized transcriptomes.
	{W}e also find a combinatorial utilization of shared expression subpatterns
	within individual links, with increasing quantitative similarity
	among those that connect transcriptome states induced by the deletion
	of functionally related gene products. {T}his suggests a distinct
	hierarchical and combinatorial organization of the {S}. cerevisiae
	transcriptional activity, and may represent a pattern that is generic
	to the transcriptional organization of all eukaryotic organisms.

	of {RNA} has revealed an increasing range of {RNA}'s structural repertoire.
	{T}oward the objective of systematic cataloguing of {RNA}'s structural
	repertoire, we have recently described the basis of a graphical approach
	for organizing {RNA} secondary structures, including existing and
	hypothetical motifs. {DESCRIPTION}: {W}e now present an {RNA} motif
	database based on graph theory, termed {RAG} for {RNA}-{A}s-{G}raphs,
	to catalogue and rank all theoretically possible, including existing,
	candidate and hypothetical, {RNA} secondary motifs. {T}he candidate
	motifs are predicted using a clustering algorithm that classifies
	{RNA} graphs into {RNA}-like and non-{RNA} groups. {A}ll {RNA} motifs
	are filed according to their graph vertex number ({RNA} length) and
	ranked by topological complexity. {CONCLUSIONS}: {RAG}'s quantitative
	cataloguing allows facile retrieval of all classes of {RNA} secondary
	motifs, assists identification of structural and functional properties
	of user-supplied {RNA} sequences, and helps stimulate the search
	for novel {RNA}s based on predicted candidate motifs.},

	three leucine zippers, of which one is bipartite, and two widely

	15,964 different m{RNA}s. {F}or tag to gene assignment, we developed
	a computational approach based on 26,620 genes annotated from the
	complete sequence of the genome. {T}he procedure selected warrants
	the identification of the genes corresponding to the majority of
	the tags found experimentally, with a high level of reliability,
	and provides a reference database for {SAGE} studies in {A}rabidopsis.
	{T}his new resource allowed us to characterize the expression of
	more than 3,000 genes, for which there is no expressed sequence tag
	({EST}) or c{DNA} in the databases. {M}oreover, 85\% of the tags
	were specific for one gene. {T}o illustrate this advantage of {SAGE}
	for functional genomics, we show that our data allow an unambiguous
	analysis of most of the individual genes belonging to 12 different
	ion transporter multigene families. {T}hese results indicate that,
	compared with {EST}-based tag to gene assignment, the use of the
	annotated genome sequence greatly improves gene identification in
	{SAGE} studies. {H}owever, more than 6,000 different tags remained
	with no gene match, suggesting that a significant proportion of transcripts
	present in the roots originate from yet unknown or wrongly annotated
	genes. {T}he root transcriptome characterized in this study markedly
	differs from those obtained in other organs, and provides a unique
	resource for investigating the functional specificities of the root

  abstract = {The ability to fold into well-defined native conformation is a prerequisite
	for biologically functional biopolymers. {S}ince {RNA} secondary
	structure can be computed relatively easily and accurately it provides
	an ideal model system for theoretical investigations. {T}he topology
	of the energy landscape of a given sequence strongly influences its
	folding pathways and mechanisms. {T}he energy landscape for {RNA}
	molecules is believed to be rugged, exhibiting many deep local optima,
	in which the folding process may become trapped. {I}n this thesis
	a kinetic folding algorithm has been developed in order to study
	the dynamics of {RNA} folding on such an energy landscape. {T}he
	new algorithm uses the most elementary move set possible for the
	inter conversion of {RNA} secondary structure. {I}t consists in the
	insertion or the removal of single base pairs, as well as the exchange
	of one pairing partner in a base pair. {S}ince the changes made during
	one simulation step are small, no unrealistic assumptions about the
	transition rates have to be made. {F}urthermore a more realistic
	concept of a folding path arises, if the introduced structural changes
	are small. {F}olding simulations of natural and artificial t{RNA}
	sequences exhibit cases where the sequence finds the native state
	eciently and often via the same intermediate structures, as well
	as cases where a large fraction of runs get trapped in local minima
	from which they cannot escape on the time-scale of the simulation.
	{B}y prohibiting base pairing for a few crucial nucleotides, the
	base modifications present in natural t{RNA}s strongly bias the folding
	kinetics as well as the equilibrium ensemble towards the native state.
	{A}n analysis of the folding behaviour of various t{RNA}s shows,
	that the folding process is hierarchically organized. {L}ocal secondary
	structure elements form early and progressively reorganize into larger
	sub-domains during the folding process. {O}ften secondary structure
	elements near the 5-end form faster, than comparable ones near the
	3-end. {T}his might well be a result of evolutionary selection of
	sequences to support ecient folding during transcription. {I}nformation
	about folding paths can be inferred directly from folding simulations.
	{I}n particular, important kinetic traps can be easily identified.
	{F}or small {RNA} molecules it is possible to observe the escape
	from such traps within the simulation time. {S}imulations of {SV}-11,
	an {RNA} molecule with a known metastable structure, are in excellent
	agreement with experimentally measured data.},

	{RNA} {W}eb {S}ite and {R}fam, there is a growing need for accurately
	and automatically predicting {RNA} structures from multiple alignments.
	{S}ince {RNA} secondary structure is often conserved in evolution,
	the well known, but underused, mutual information measure for identifying
	covarying sites in an alignment can be useful for identifying structural
	elements. {T}his article presents {MI}fold, a {MATLAB}(({R})) toolbox
	that employs mutual information, or a related covariation measure,
	to display and predict conserved {RNA} secondary structure (including
	pseudoknots) from an alignment. {RESULTS}: {W}e show that {MI}fold
	can be used to predict simple pseudoknots, and that the performance
	can be adjusted to make it either more sensitive or more selective.
	{W}e also demonstrate that the overall performance of {MI}fold improves
	with the number of aligned sequences for certain types of {RNA} sequences.
	{I}n addition, we show that, for these sequences, {MI}fold is more
	sensitive but less selective than the related {RNA}alifold structure
	prediction program and is comparable with the {COVE} structure prediction
	package. {CONCLUSION}: {MI}fold provides a useful supplementary tool
	to programs such as {RNA} {S}tructure {L}ogo, {RNA}alifold and {COVE},

  abstract = {A{BSTRACT}: {BACKGROUND}: {O}rthologs (genes that have diverged after
	a speciation event) tend to have similar function, and so their prediction
	has become an important component of comparative genomics and genome
	annotation. {T}he gold standard phylogenetic analysis approach of
	comparing available organismal phylogeny to gene phylogeny is not
	easily automated for genome-wide analysis; therefore, ortholog prediction
	for large genome-scale datasets is typically performed using a reciprocal-best-{BLAST}-hits
	({RBH}) approach. {O}ne problem with {RBH} is that it will incorrectly
	predict a paralog as an ortholog when incomplete genome sequences
	or gene loss is involved. {I}n addition, there is an increasing interest
	in identifying orthologs most likely to have retained similar function.
	{RESULTS}: {T}o address these issues, we present here a high-throughput
	computational method named {O}rtholuge that further evaluates previously
	predicted orthologs (including those predicted using an {RBH}-based
	approach) - identifying which orthologs most closely reflect species
	divergence and may more likely have similar function. {O}rtholuge
	analyzes phylogenetic distance ratios involving two comparison species
	and an outgroup species, noting cases where relative gene divergence
	is atypical. {I}t also identifies some cases of gene duplication
	after species divergence. {T}hrough simulations of incomplete genome
	data/gene loss, we show that the vast majority of genes falsely predicted
	as orthologs by an {RBH}-based method can be identified. {O}rtholuge
	was then used to estimate the number of false-positives (predominantly
	paralogs) in selected {RBH}-predicted ortholog datasets, identifying
	approximately 10\% paralogs in a eukaryotic data set (mouse-rat comparison)
	and 5\% in a bacterial data set ({P}seudomonas putida-{P}seudomonas
	syringae species comparison). {H}igher quality (more precise) datasets
	of orthologs, which we term ssd-orthologs (supporting-species-divergence-orthologs),
	were also constructed. {T}hese datasets, as well as {O}rtholuge software
	that may be used to characterize other species datasets, are available
	at http://www.pathogenomics.ca/ortholuge/ (software under {GNU} {G}eneral
	{P}ublic {L}icense). {CONCLUSIONS}: {T}he {O}rtholuge method reported
	here appears to significantly improve the specificity (precision)
	of high-throughput ortholog prediction for both bacterial and eukaryotic
	species. {T}his method, and its associated software, will aid those

	coregulation of effectors and the T3S system. In X. campestris pv.
	vesicatoria, HpaB and HpaC (HpaP in X. oryzae pv. oryzae) have a
	central role in recruiting T3S substrates to the secretion apparatus.
	Secretion of all but one effector was reduced in both HpaB() and

	3-node {M}osix and {B}eowulf clusters. {I}ndividual binding sites
	are displayed either as high-resolution sequence walkers or in low-resolution
	custom tracks in the {UCSC} genome browser. {F}or large datasets,
	we applied a data reduction strategy that limited displays of binding
	sites exceeding a threshold information content to specific chromosomal
	regions within or adjacent to genes. {A}n {HTML} document is produced
	listing binding sites ranked by binding site strength or chromosomal
	location hyperlinked to the {UCSC} custom track, other annotation
	databases and binding site sequences. {P}ost-genome scan tools parse
	binding site annotations of selected chromosome intervals and compare
	the results of genome scans using different weight matrices. {C}omparisons
	of multiple genome scans can display binding sites that are unique
	to each scan and identify sites with significantly altered binding
	strengths. {CONCLUSIONS}: {D}elila-{G}enome was used to scan the
	human genome sequence with information weight matrices of transcription
	factor binding sites, including {PXR}/{RXR}alpha, {AHR} and {NF}-kappa{B}
	p50/p65, and matrices for {RNA} binding sites including splice donor,
	acceptor, and {SC}35 recognition sites. {C}omparisons of genome scans
	with the original and refined {PXR}/{RXR}alpha information weight
	matrices indicate that the refined model more accurately predicts
	the strengths of known binding sites and is more sensitive for detection

  title = {Discovering biclusters in gene expression data based on high-dimensional
	linear geometries.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {9},
  pages = {209},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In DNA microarray experiments, discovering groups of genes
	that share similar transcriptional characteristics is instrumental
	in functional annotation, tissue classification and motif identification.
	However, in many situations a subset of genes only exhibits consistent
	pattern over a subset of conditions. Conventional clustering algorithms
	that deal with the entire row or column in an expression matrix would
	therefore fail to detect these useful patterns in the data. Recently,
	biclustering has been proposed to detect a subset of genes exhibiting
	consistent pattern over a subset of conditions. However, most existing
	biclustering algorithms are based on searching for sub-matrices within
	a data matrix by optimizing certain heuristically defined merit functions.
	Moreover, most of these algorithms can only detect a restricted set
	of bicluster patterns. RESULTS: In this paper, we present a novel
	geometric perspective for the biclustering problem. The biclustering
	process is interpreted as the detection of linear geometries in a
	high dimensional data space. Such a new perspective views biclusters
	with different patterns as hyperplanes in a high dimensional space,
	and allows us to handle different types of linear patterns simultaneously
	by matching a specific set of linear geometries. This geometric viewpoint
	also inspires us to propose a generic bicluster pattern, i.e. the
	linear coherent model that unifies the seemingly incompatible additive
	and multiplicative bicluster models. As a particular realization
	of our framework, we have implemented a Hough transform-based hyperplane
	detection algorithm. The experimental results on human lymphoma gene
	expression dataset show that our algorithm can find biologically
	significant subsets of genes. CONCLUSION: We have proposed a novel
	geometric interpretation of the biclustering problem. We have shown
	that many common types of bicluster are just different spatial arrangements
	of hyperplanes in a high dimensional data space. An implementation
	of the geometric framework using the Fast Hough transform for hyperplane
	detection can be used to discover biologically significant subsets
	of genes under subsets of conditions for microarray data analysis.},

	{R}ecognizing short genes in prokaryotes and short exons in eukaryotes

	{RESULTS}: {T}he databases consisting of phase-specific coding and

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, comparative biological analyses have undergone
	profound changes with the incorporation of rigorous evolutionary
	perspectives and phylogenetic information. This change followed in
	large part from the realization that traditional methods of statistical
	analysis tacitly assumed independence of all observations, when in
	fact biological groups such as species are differentially related
	to each other according to their evolutionary history. New phylogenetically
	based analytical methods were then rapidly developed, incorporated
	into ;the comparative method', and applied to many physiological,
	biochemical, morphological and behavioral investigations. We now
	review the rationale for including phylogenetic information in comparative
	studies and briefly discuss three methods for doing this (independent
	contrasts, generalized least-squares models, and Monte Carlo computer
	simulations). We discuss when and how to use phylogenetic information
	in comparative studies and provide several examples in which it has
	been helpful, or even crucial, to a comparative analysis. We also
	consider some difficulties with phylogenetically based statistical
	methods, and of comparative approaches in general, both practical
	and theoretical. It is our personal opinion that the incorporation
	of phylogeny information into comparative studies has been highly
	beneficial, not only because it can improve the reliability of statistical
	inferences, but also because it continually emphasizes the potential
	importance of past evolutionary history in determining current form
	and function.},

	in particular in the ratio of axonal growth-promoting components
	such as laminin to growth-inhibiting molecules, could contribute
	to the degenerative changes observed in the innervation of some peripheral
	tissues in old age. We have investigated this issue by evaluating
	laminin content or accessibility at various locations on blood vessels
	where we had previously studied age-related alterations in innervation
	density. We have employed a morphological approach, measuring laminin
	immunoreactivity by a densitometric application of confocal microscopy,
	because more conventional biochemical techniques would have been
	unable to distinguish specific, localized changes in laminin at sites
	accessible to nerves from heterogeneous changes in other areas of
	the vessel wall, such as the endothelial basal lamina. We found that
	in 24-month-old rats laminin immunoreactivity is decreased by 50\%
	at the medial-adventitial border in association with the outer layer
	of smooth muscle cells, where a parallel decrease is observed in
	innervation density. Axonal terminals were shown to have access to
	laminin in this region of the blood vessel wall by double staining
	with laminin and a general neuronal marker. Changes in laminin immunoreactivity
	were region-specific on the same blood vessel, thus excluding the
	possibility of a generalized decrease in immunoreactivity in old
	age. For example, in the basilar artery intensity of laminin immunoreactivity
	decreased in old age at the medial-adventitial border, but showed
	no change in endothelial cell basal lamina and in the adventitia.
	Moreover, we performed in oculo transplants of blood vessels displaying
	differences in laminin immunoreactivity and found that the density
	of innervation correlated with the intensity of laminin staining,
	thus lending further support to the hypothesis that laminin might
	play a role in nerve fibre atrophy in old age.},

	a degenerate 35 amino acid motif that occurs in multiple tandem copies
	in members of a recently recognized eukaryotic gene family. {M}ost
	analyzed eukaryotic genomes contain only a small number of {PPR}
	genes, but in plants the family is greatly expanded. {T}he factors
	that underlie the expansion of this gene family in plants are not
	as yet understood. {RESULTS}: {W}e show that the location of {PPR}
	genes is highly variable in comparisons between orthologous, closely
	related, and otherwise co-linear chromosomal regions of the {B}rassica
	rapa or radish and {A}rabidopsis thaliana. {T}his observation also
	pertains to paralogous duplicated segments of the genomes of {A}rabidopsis
	thaliana and {B}rassica rapa. {I}n addition, we show that {PPR} genes
	that seem closely linearly aligned in these comparisons are not generally
	found to be closely related to one another at the nucleotide and
	amino acid sequence level. {W}e observe a relatively high level of
	non-synonomous vs synonomous changes among a group tandemly repeated
	radish {PPR} genes, suggesting that these, and possibly other {PPR}
	genes, are subject to diversifying selection. {W}e also show that
	a duplicated region of the {A}rabidopsis genome possesses a relatively
	high density of {PPR} genes showing high similarity to restorers
	of fertility of cytoplasmic male sterile ({CMS}) systems of petunia,
	radish and rice. {T}he {PPR} genes in these regions, together with
	the restorer genes, are more highly similar to one another, in sequence
	as well as in structure, than to other {PPR} genes, even within the
	same sub-family. {CONCLUSION}: {O}ur results suggest are consistent
	with a model in which at least some {PPR} genes undergo a "birth
	and death" process that involves transposition to unrelated chromosomal
	sites. {PPR} genes hold certain features in common with disease resistance
	genes ({R} genes), and their "nomadic" character suggests that their
	evolutionary expansion in plants may have involved novel molecular
	processes and selective pressures.},

  abstract = {Abscisic acid ({ABA}) is a major plant hormone that plays an important
	role during plant growth and development. {D}uring vegetative growth
	{ABA} mediates (in part) responses to various environmental stresses
	such as cold, drought and high salinity. {T}he response triggered
	by {ABA} includes changes in the transcript level of genes involved
	in stress tolerance. {T}he aim of this project was the {I}n silico
	identification of genes putatively regulated by {ABA} in {A}. thaliana.
	{I}n silico predictions were combined with experimental data in order
	to evaluate the reliability of computational predictions.
	
	{T}aking advantage of the genome sequence of {A}. thaliana publicly
	available since 2000, 1 kb upstream sequences were screened for combinations
	of cis-elements known to be involved in the regulation of {ABA}-responsive
	genes. {I}t was found that around 10 to 20 percent of the genes of
	{A}. thaliana might be regulated by {ABA}.
	
	{F}urther analyses of the predictions revealed that certain combinations
	of cis-elements that confer {ABA}-responsiveness were significantly
	over-represented compared with results in random sequences and with
	random expectations. {I}n addition, it was observed that other combinations
	that confer {ABA}-responsiveness in monocotyledonous species might
	not be functional in {A}. thaliana. {I}t is proposed that {ABA}-responsive
	genes in {A}. thaliana show pairs of {ABRE} (abscisic acid responsive
	element) with {MYB} binding sites, {DRE} (dehydration responsive
	element) or with itself.
	
	{T}he analysis of the distances between pairs of cis-elements suggested
	that pairs of {ABRE}s are bound by homodimers of {ABRE} binding proteins.
	{I}n contrast, pairs between {MYB} binding sites and {ABRE}, or {DRE}
	and {ABRE} showed a distance between cis-elements that suggested
	that the binding proteins interact through protein complexes and
	not directly.
	
	{T}he comparison of computational predictions with experimental data
	confirmed that the regulatory mechanisms leading to the induction
	or repression of genes by {ABA} is very incompletely understood.
	{I}t became evident that besides the cis-elements proposed in this
	study to be present in {ABA}-responsive genes, other known and unknown
	cis-elements might play an important role in the transcriptional
	regulation of {ABA}-responsive genes. {F}or example, auxin-related
	cis elements, or the cis-elements recognized by the {NAM}-family
	of transcription factors ({N}on-{A}pical meristem).
	
	{T}his work documents the use of computational and experimental approaches
	to analyse possible interactions between cis-elements involved in
	the regulation of {ABA}-responsive genes. {T}he computational predictions
	allowed the distinction between putatively relevant combinations
	of cis-elements from irrelevant combinations of cis-elements in {ABA}-responsive
	genes. {T}he comparison with experimental data allowed to identify
	certain cis-elements that have not been previously associated to
	the {ABA}-mediated transcriptional regulation, but that might be
	present in {ABA}-responsive genes (e.g. auxin responsive elements).
	{M}oreover, the efforts to unravel the gene regulatory network associated
	with the {ABA}-signalling pathway revealed that {NAM}-transcription
	factors and their corresponding binding sequences are important components
	of this network.},

  abstract = {A{BSTRACT}: {BACKGROUND}: {I}n plants, complex regulatory mechanisms
	are at the core of physiological and developmental processes. {T}he
	phytohormone abscisic acid ({ABA}) is involved in the regulation
	of various such processes, including stomatal closure, seed and bud
	dormancy, and physiological responses to cold, drought and salinity
	stress. {T}he underlying tissue or plant-wide control circuits often
	include combinatorial gene regulatory mechanisms and networks that
	we are only beginning to unravel with the help of new molecular tools.
	{T}he increasing availability of genomic sequences and gene expression
	data enables us to dissect {ABA} regulatory mechanisms at the individual
	gene expression level. {I}n this paper we used an in-silico-based
	approach directed towards genome-wide prediction and identification
	of specific features of {ABA}-responsive elements. {I}n particular
	we analysed the genome-wide occurrence and positional arrangements
	of two well-described {ABA}-responsive cis-regulatory elements ({CRE}s),
	{ABRE} and {CE}3, in thale cress ({A}rabidopsis thaliana) and rice
	({O}ryza sativa). {RESULTS}: {O}ur results show that {A}rabidopsis
	and rice use the {ABA}-responsive elements {ABRE} and {CE}3 distinctively.
	{E}arlier reports for various monocots have identified {CE}3 as a
	coupling element ({CE}) associated with {ABRE}. {S}urprisingly, we
	found that while {ABRE} is equally abundant in both species, {CE}3
	is practically absent in {A}rabidopsis. {ABRE}-{ABRE} pairs are common
	in both genomes, suggesting that these can form functional {ABA}-responsive
	complexes ({ABRC}s) in {A}rabidopsis and rice. {F}urthermore, we
	detected distinct combinations, orientation patterns and {DNA} strand
	preferences of {ABRE} and {CE}3 motifs in rice gene promoters. {CONCLUSION}:
	{O}ur computational analyses revealed distinct recruitment patterns
	of {ABA}-responsive {CRE}s in upstream sequences of {A}rabidopsis
	and rice. {T}he apparent absence of {CE}3s in {A}rabidopsis suggests
	that another {CE} pairs with {ABRE} to establish a functional {ABRC}
	capable of interacting with transcription factors. {F}urther studies
	will be needed to test whether the observed differences are extrapolatable
	to monocots and dicots in general, and to understand how they contribute
	to the fine-tuning of the hormonal response. {T}he outcome of our
	investigation can now be used to direct future experimentation designed
	to further dissect the {ABA}-dependent regulatory networks.},

  abstract = {An adaptationist programme has dominated evolutionary thought in England
	and the United States during the past 40 years. It is based on faith
	in the power of natural selection as an optimizing agent. It proceeds
	by breaking an oragnism into unitary 'traits' and proposing an adaptive
	story for each considered separately. Trade-offs among competing
	selective demands exert the only brake upon perfection; non-optimality
	is thereby rendered as a result of adaptation as well. We criticize
	this approach and attempt to reassert a competing notion (long popular
	in continental Europe) that organisms must be analysed as integrated
	wholes, with Baupl‰ne so constrained by phyletic heritage, pathways
	of development and general architecture that the constraints themselves
	become more interesting and more important in delimiting pathways
	of change than the selective force that may mediate change when it
	occurs. We fault the adaptationist programme for its failure to distinguish
	current utility from reasons for origin (male tyrannosaurs may have
	used their diminutive front legs to titillate female partners, but
	this will not explain why they got so small); for its unwillingness
	to consider alternatives to adaptive stories; for its reliance upon
	plausibility alone as a criterion for accepting speculative tales;
	and for its failure to consider adequately such competing themes
	as random fixation of alleles, production of non-adaptive structures
	by developmental correlation with selected features (allometry, pleiotropy,
	material compensation, mechanically forced correlation), the separability
	of adaptation and selection, multiple adaptive peaks, and current
	utility as an epiphenomenon of non-adaptive structures. We support
	Darwin's own pluralistic approach to identifying the agents of evolutionary

	through many different cellular processes. {U}p to now, there have
	been conflicting results on how correlated the levels of these two
	quantities are. {G}iven that expression and abundance data are significantly
	more complex and noisy than the underlying genomic sequence information,
	it is reasonable to simplify and average them in terms of broad proteomic
	categories and features (e.g. functions or secondary structures),
	for understanding their relationship. {F}urthermore, it will be essential
	to integrate, within a common framework, the results of many varied
	experiments by different investigators. {T}his will allow one to
	survey the characteristics of highly expressed genes and proteins.
	{RESULTS}: {T}o this end, we outline a formalism for merging and
	scaling many different gene expression and protein abundance data
	sets into a comprehensive reference set, and we develop an approach
	for analyzing this in terms of broad categories, such as composition,
	function, structure and localization. {A}s the various experiments
	are not always done using the same set of genes, sampling bias becomes
	a central issue, and our formalism is designed to explicitly show
	this and correct for it. {W}e apply our formalism to the currently
	available gene expression and protein abundance data for yeast. {O}verall,
	we found substantial agreement between gene expression and protein
	abundance, in terms of the enrichment of structural and functional
	categories. {T}his agreement, which was considerably greater than
	the simple correlation between these quantities for individual genes,
	reflects the way broad categories collect many individual measurements
	into simple, robust averages. {I}n particular, we found that in comparison
	to the population of genes in the yeast genome, the cellular populations
	of transcripts and proteins (weighted by their respective abundances,
	the transcriptome and what we dub the translatome) were both enriched
	in: (i) the small amino acids {V}al, {G}ly, and {A}la; (ii) low molecular
	weight proteins; (iii) helices and sheets relative to coils; (iv)
	cytoplasmic proteins relative to nuclear ones; and (v) proteins involved
	in 'protein synthesis,' 'cell structure,' and 'energy production.'

  abstract = {It remains controversial why mitochondria and chloroplasts retain
	the genes encoding a small subset of their constituent proteins,
	despite the transfer of so many other genes to the nucleus. {T}wo
	candidate obstacles to gene transfer, suggested long ago, are that
	the genetic code of some mitochondrial genomes differs from the standard
	nuclear code, such that a transferred gene would encode an incorrect
	amino acid sequence, and that the proteins most frequently encoded
	in mitochondria are generally very hydrophobic, which may impede
	their import after synthesis in the cytosol. {M}ore recently it has
	been suggested that both these interpretations suffer from serious
	"false positives" and "false negatives": genes that they predict
	should be readily transferred but which have never (or seldom) been,
	and genes whose transfer has occurred often or early, even though
	this is predicted to be very difficult. {H}ere {I} consider the full
	known range of ostensibly problematic such genes, with particular
	reference to the sequences of events that could have led to their
	present location. {I} show that this detailed analysis of these cases
	reveals that they are in fact wholly consistent with the hypothesis
	that code disparity and hydrophobicity are much more powerful barriers
	to functional gene transfer than any other. {T}he popularity of the
	contrary view has led to the search for other barriers that might
	retain genes in organelles even more powerfully than code disparity
	or hydrophobicity; one proposal, concerning the role of proteins
	in redox processes, has received widespread support. {I} conclude
	that this abandonment of the original explanations for the retention
	of organellar genomes has been premature. {S}everal other, relatively
	minor, obstacles to gene transfer certainly exist, contributing to
	the retention of relatively many organellar genes in most lineages
	compared to animal mt{DNA}, but there is no evidence for obstacles
	as severe as code disparity or hydrophobicity. {O}ne corollary of
	this conclusion is that there is currently no reason to suppose that
	engineering nuclear versions of the remaining mammalian mitochondrial
	genes, a feat that may have widespread biomedical relevance, should
	require anything other than sequence alterations obviating code disparity
	and causing modest reductions in hydrophobicity without loss of enzymatic
	function.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biclustering of gene expression data searches for local
	patterns of gene expression. A bicluster (or a two-way cluster) is
	defined as a set of genes whose expression profiles are mutually
	similar within a subset of experimental conditions/samples. Although
	several biclustering algorithms have been studied, few are based
	on rigorous statistical models. RESULTS: We developed a Bayesian
	biclustering model (BBC), and implemented a Gibbs sampling procedure
	for its statistical inference. We showed that Bayesian biclustering
	model can correctly identify multiple clusters of gene expression
	data. Using simulated data both from the model and with realistic
	characters, we demonstrated the BBC algorithm outperforms other methods
	in both robustness and accuracy. We also showed that the model is
	stable for two normalization methods, the interquartile range normalization
	and the smallest quartile range normalization. Applying the BBC algorithm
	to the yeast expression data, we observed that majority of the biclusters
	we found are supported by significant biological evidences, such
	as enrichments of gene functions and transcription factor binding
	sites in the corresponding promoter sequences. CONCLUSIONS: The BBC
	algorithm is shown to be a robust model-based biclustering method
	that can discover biologically significant gene-condition clusters
	in microarray data. The BBC model can easily handle missing data
	via Monte Carlo imputation and has the potential to be extended to
	integrated study of gene transcription networks.},

	efficiency in Escherichia coli, and that translation is more efficient
	the less stable the secondary structure. We survey the complete genomes
	of 340 species for signals of reduced mRNA secondary structure near
	the start codon. Our analysis includes bacteria, archaea, fungi,
	plants, insects, fishes, birds, and mammals. We find that nearly
	all species show evidence for reduced mRNA stability near the start
	codon. The reduction in stability generally increases with increasing
	genomic GC content. In prokaryotes, the reduction also increases
	with decreasing optimal growth temperature. Within genomes, there
	is variation in the stability among genes, and this variation correlates
	with gene GC content, codon bias, and gene expression level. For
	birds and mammals, however, we do not find a genome-wide trend of
	reduced mRNA stability near the start codon. Yet the most GC rich
	genes in these organisms do show such a signal. We conclude that
	reduced stability of the mRNA secondary structure near the start
	codon is a universal feature of all cellular life. We suggest that
	the origin of this reduction is selection for efficient recognition

  abstract = {B{ACKGROUND}: {A}nnotation of eukaryotic genomes is a complex endeavor
	that requires the integration of evidence from multiple, often contradictory,
	sources. {W}ith the ever-increasing amount of genome sequence data
	now available, methods for accurate identification of large numbers
	of genes have become urgently needed. {I}n an effort to create a
	set of very high-quality gene models, we used the sequence of 5,000
	full-length gene transcripts from {A}rabidopsis to re-annotate its
	genome. {W}e have mapped these transcripts to their exact chromosomal
	locations and, using alignment programs, have created gene models
	that provide a reference set for this organism. {RESULTS}: {A}pproximately
	35\% of the transcripts indicated that previously annotated genes
	needed modification, and 5\% of the transcripts represented newly
	discovered genes. {W}e also discovered that multiple transcription
	initiation sites appear to be much more common than previously known,
	and we report numerous cases of alternative m{RNA} splicing. {W}e
	include a comparison of different alignment software and an analysis
	of how the transcript data improved the previously published annotation.
	{CONCLUSIONS}: {O}ur results demonstrate that sequencing of large
	numbers of full-length transcripts followed by computational mapping
	greatly improves identification of the complete exon structures of
	eukaryotic genes. {I}n addition, we are able to find numerous introns
	in the untranslated regions of the genes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Flesh flies in the genus Sarcophaga are important models
	for investigating endocrinology, diapause, cold hardiness, reproduction,
	and immunity. Despite the prominence of Sarcophaga flesh flies as
	models for insect physiology and biochemistry, and in forensic studies,
	little genomic or transcriptomic data are available for members of
	this genus. We used massively parallel pyrosequencing on the Roche
	454-FLX platform to produce a substantial EST dataset for the flesh
	fly Sarcophaga crassipalpis. To maximize sequence diversity, we pooled
	RNA extracted from whole bodies of all life stages and normalized
	the cDNA pool after reverse transcription. RESULTS: We obtained 207,110
	ESTs with an average read length of 241 bp. These reads assembled
	into 20,995 contigs and 31,056 singletons. Using BLAST searches of
	the NR and NT databases we were able to identify 11,757 unique gene
	elements (E<0.0001) representing approximately 9,000 independent
	transcripts. Comparison of the distribution of S. crassipalpis unigenes
	among GO Biological Process functional groups with that of the Drosophila
	melanogaster transcriptome suggests that our ESTs are broadly representative
	of the flesh fly transcriptome. Insertion and deletion errors in
	454 sequencing present a serious hurdle to comparative transcriptome
	analysis. Aided by a new approach to correcting for these errors,
	we performed a comparative analysis of genetic divergence across
	GO categories among S. crassipalpis, D. melanogaster, and Anopheles
	gambiae. The results suggest that non-synonymous substitutions occur
	at similar rates across categories, although genes related to response
	to stimuli may evolve slightly faster. In addition, we identified
	over 500 potential microsatellite loci and more than 12,000 SNPs
	among our ESTs. CONCLUSION: Our data provides the first large-scale
	EST-project for flesh flies, a much-needed resource for exploring
	this model species. In addition, we identified a large number of
	potential microsatellite and SNP markers that could be used in population
	and systematic studies of S. crassipalpis and other flesh flies.},

  abstract = {The LEAFY (LFY) protein is a key regulator of flower development in
	angiosperms. Its gradually increased expression governs the sharp
	floral transition, and LFY subsequently controls the patterning of
	flower meristems by inducing the expression of floral homeotic genes.
	Despite a wealth of genetic data, how LFY functions at the molecular
	level is poorly understood. Here, we report crystal structures for
	the DNA-binding domain of Arabidopsis thaliana LFY bound to two target
	promoter elements. LFY adopts a novel seven-helix fold that binds
	DNA as a cooperative dimer, forming base-specific contacts in both
	the major and minor grooves. Cooperativity is mediated by two basic
	residues and plausibly accounts for LFY's effectiveness in triggering
	sharp developmental transitions. Our structure reveals an unexpected
	similarity between LFY and helix-turn-helix proteins, including homeodomain
	proteins known to regulate morphogenesis in higher eukaryotes. The
	appearance of flowering plants has been linked to the molecular evolution
	of LFY. Our study provides a unique framework to elucidate the molecular
	mechanisms underlying floral development and the evolutionary history
	of flowering plants.},

	that these preparations were structurally homologous to ventricular

	was stained with the fluorophore Sirius Red F3BA and embedded in
	resin, sequential optical sectioning enabled 3-D reconstruction of

	upon blood pressure, blood pressure reactivity and vascular contractility
	in Wistar rats. DESIGN: Wistar rats were fed a liquid diet containing
	36\% ethanol; control rats were pair fed. METHODS: Rats were maintained
	on diets for 18 weeks. Indirect systolic blood pressure was measured
	weekly. Catheters were implanted for assessment of direct arterial
	pressure and blood pressure reactivity to norepinephrine, angiotensin
	II and ethanol injections. In a subgroup of rats, contractility of
	isolated mesenteric resistance vessels was measured. RESULTS: In
	comparison with simultaneously pair-fed controls, ethanol-treated
	rats developed significantly lower blood pressure within 3 weeks
	of exposure to alcohol; this continued throughout the study. Despite
	the reduction in blood pressure, in vitro assessment of vascular
	contractility in mesenteric resistance vessels indicated that ethanol
	consumption significantly enhanced vascular contractility to norepinephrine
	and attenuated the vasodepressive effects of ethanol. Measurement
	of blood pressure reactivity to infused pressor agents showed no
	difference between controls and ethanol-treated rats in response
	to norepinephrine but a significantly attenuated pressor response
	to angiotensin II was observed in ethanol-treated rats. CONCLUSIONS:
	The blood pressure results contrast with reports of elevated blood
	pressure in Wistar rats given ethanol in drinking water. This disparity
	may be due to nutritional factors. Increased vascular contractility
	combined with hypotension suggests that cardiovascular regulatory
	systems offset the direct effects of ethanol upon the vasculature.
	This view is reinforced by the lack of difference between groups
	in blood pressure reactivity to norepinephrine. The attenuated angiotensin
	II responses in the ethanol-treated rats suggests altered levels
	of circulating angiotensin II in this group.},

  abstract = {M{OTIVATION}: {S}earching for non-coding {RNA} (nc{RNA}) genes and
	structural {RNA} elements (ele{RNA}) are major challenges in todays
	gene finding as these often are conserved in structure rather than
	in sequence. {E}ven though the number of available methods is growing,
	it is still of interest to pairwise detect two genes with low sequence
	similarity, where the genes are part of a larger genomic region.
	{RESULTS}: {H}ere we present such an approach for pairwise local
	alignment which is based on {FOLDALIGN} and the {S}ankoff algorithm
	for simultaneous structural alignment of multiple sequences. {W}e
	include the ability to conduct mutual scan of two sequences of arbitrary
	length while searching for common local structural motifs of some
	maximum length. {T}his drastically reduces the complexity of the
	algorithm. {T}he scoring scheme includes structural parameters corresponding
	to those available for free energy as well as for substitution matrices
	similar to {RIBOSUM}. {T}he new {FOLDALIGN} implementation is tested
	on a data set where the nc{RNA}s and ele{RNA}s have sequence similarity
	less than 40\% and where the nc{RNA}s and ele{RNA}s cannot energetically
	be distinguished from the surrounding genomic sequence context. {T}he
	method is tested in two ways: (1) its pure ability to find the common
	structure between the genes only, and (2) its ability to locate nc{RNA}s
	and ele{RNA}s in a genomic context. {I}n case (1) it make sense to
	compare to methods like {D}ynalign, and the performances are very
	similar, but {FOLDALIGN} is substantially faster. {T}he structure
	prediction performance for a family is typically around 0.7 using

	expression data coming from {DNA} array experiments, using an unsupervised
	neural network. {DNA} array technologies allow monitoring thousands
	of genes rapidly and efficiently. {O}ne of the interests of these
	studies is the search for correlated gene expression patterns, and
	this is usually achieved by clustering them. {T}he {S}elf-{O}rganising
	{T}ree {A}lgorithm, ({SOTA}) ({D}opazo,{J}. and {C}arazo,{J}.{M}.
	(1997) {J}. {M}ol. {E}vol., 44, 226-233), is a neural network that
	grows adopting the topology of a binary tree. {T}he result of the
	algorithm is a hierarchical cluster obtained with the accuracy and
	robustness of a neural network. {RESULTS}: {SOTA} clustering confers
	several advantages over classical hierarchical clustering methods.
	{SOTA} is a divisive method: the clustering process is performed
	from top to bottom, i.e. the highest hierarchical levels are resolved
	before going to the details of the lowest levels. {T}he growing can
	be stopped at the desired hierarchical level. {M}oreover, a criterion
	to stop the growing of the tree, based on the approximate distribution
	of probability obtained by randomisation of the original data set,
	is provided. {B}y means of this criterion, a statistical support
	for the definition of clusters is proposed. {I}n addition, obtaining
	average gene expression patterns is a built-in feature of the algorithm.
	{D}ifferent neurons defining the different hierarchical levels represent
	the averages of the gene expression patterns contained in the clusters.
	{S}ince {SOTA} runtimes are approximately linear with the number
	of items to be classified, it is especially suitable for dealing
	with huge amounts of data. {T}he method proposed is very general
	and applies to any data providing that they can be coded as a series
	of numbers and that a computable measure of similarity between data
	items can be used. {AVAILABILITY}: {A} server running the program

	: {W}e used protein microarray technology to generate a protein interaction
	map for 12 of the 13 {WW} domains present in proteins of the yeast
	{S}. cerevisiae. {W}e observed 587 interactions between these 12
	domains and 207 proteins, most of which have not previously been
	described. {W}e analyzed the representation of functional annotations
	within the network, identifying enrichments for proteins with peroxisomal
	localization, as well as for proteins involved in protein turnover
	and cofactor biosynthesis. {W}e compared orthologs of the interacting
	proteins to identify conserved motifs known to mediate {WW} domain
	interactions, and found substantial evidence for the structural conservation
	of such binding motifs throughout the yeast lineages. {T}he comparative
	approach also revealed that several of the {WW} domain-containing
	proteins themselves have evolutionarily conserved {WW} domain binding

	: {P}rotein microarrays provide an appealing alternative to existing

	illustrated by the examples of magnetization and {B}√©nard convection,
	and concludes with the basics of mathematical modelling. {S}elf-organization
	can be defined as the spontaneous creation of a globally coherent
	pattern out of local interactions. {B}ecause of its distributed character,
	this organization tends to be robust, resisting perturbations. {T}he
	dynamics of a self-organizing system is typically non-linear, because
	of circular or feedback relations between the components. {P}ositive
	feedback leads to an explosive growth, which ends when all components
	have been absorbed into the new configuration, leaving the system
	in a stable, negative feedback state. {N}on-linear systems have in
	general several stable states, and this number tends to increase
	(bifurcate) as an increasing input of energy pushes the system farther
	from its thermodynamic equilibrium. {T}o adapt to a changing environment,
	the system needs a variety of stable states that is large enough
	to react to all perturbations but not so large as to make its evolution
	uncontrollably chaotic. {T}he most adequate states are selected according
	to their fitness, either directly by the environment, or by subsystems
	that have adapted to the environment at an earlier stage. {F}ormally,
	the basic mechanism underlying self-organization is the (often noise-driven)
	variation which explores different regions in the systems state
	space until it enters an attractor. {T}his precludes further variation
	outside the attractor, and thus restricts the freedom of the systems
	components to behave independently. {T}his is equivalent to the increase
	of coherence, or decrease of statistical entropy, that defines selforganization.},

  abstract = {An important tenet of evolutionary developmental biology ("evo devo")
	is that adaptive mutations affecting morphology are more likely to
	occur in the cis-regulatory regions than in the protein-coding regions
	of genes. {T}his argument rests on two claims: (1) the modular nature
	of cis-regulatory elements largely frees them from deleterious pleiotropic
	effects, and (2) a growing body of empirical evidence appears to
	support the predominant role of gene regulatory change in adaptation,
	especially morphological adaptation. {H}ere we discuss and critique
	these assertions. {W}e first show that there is no theoretical or
	empirical basis for the evo devo contention that adaptations involving
	morphology evolve by genetic mechanisms different from those involving
	physiology and other traits. {I}n addition, some forms of protein
	evolution can avoid the negative consequences of pleiotropy, most
	notably via gene duplication. {I}n light of evo devo claims, we then
	examine the substantial data on the genetic basis of adaptation from
	both genome-wide surveys and single-locus studies. {G}enomic studies
	lend little support to the cis-regulatory theory: many of these have
	detected adaptation in protein-coding regions, including transcription
	factors, whereas few have examined regulatory regions. {T}urning
	to single-locus studies, we note that the most widely cited examples
	of adaptive cis-regulatory mutations focus on trait loss rather than
	gain, and none have yet pinpointed an evolved regulatory site. {I}n
	contrast, there are many studies that have both identified structural
	mutations and functionally verified their contribution to adaptation
	and speciation. {N}either the theoretical arguments nor the data
	from nature, then, support the claim for a predominance of cis-regulatory
	mutations in evolution. {A}lthough this claim may be true, it is
	at best premature. {A}daptation and speciation probably proceed through
	a combination of cis-regulatory and structural mutations, with a

	energy structure and the complete matrix of base pairing probabilities
	can be computed in theta({N} x {L}2) time and theta({N} + {L}2) memory
	in terms of the length {N} of the genome and the size {L} of the
	largest secondary structure motifs of interest. {I}n practice, the
	100 {M}b of the complete genome of {C}aenorhabditis elegans can be
	folded within about half a day on a modern {PC} with a search depth
	of {L} = 100. {T}his is sufficient example for a survey for mi{RNA}s.

	{S}till, the full identification of sites, even in lower eukaryotes,
	remains largely incomplete. {I}n this paper we develop a supervised
	learning approach to site identification using support vector machines
	({SVM}s) to combine 26 different data types. {A} comparison with
	the standard approach to site identification using position specific
	scoring matrices ({PSSM}s) for a set of 104 {S}accharomyces cerevisiae
	regulators indicates that our {SVM}-based target classification is
	more sensitive (73 vs. 20%) when specificity and positive predictive
	value are the same. {W}e have applied our {SVM} classifier for each
	transcriptional regulator to all promoters in the yeast genome to
	obtain thousands of new targets, which are currently being analyzed
	and refined to limit the risk of classifier over-fitting. {F}or the
	purpose of illustration we discuss several results, including biochemical
	pathway predictions for {G}cn4 and {R}ap1. {F}or both transcription
	factors {SVM} predictions match well with the known biology of control
	mechanisms, and possible new roles for these factors are suggested,
	such as a function for {R}ap1 in regulating fermentative growth.
	{W}e also examine the promoter melting temperature curves for the
	targets of {YJR}060{W}, and show that targets of this {TF} have potentially
	unique physical properties which distinguish them from other genes.
	{T}he {SVM} output automatically provides the means to rank dataset
	features to identify important biological elements. {W}e use this
	property to rank classifying k-mers, thereby reconstructing known
	binding sites for several {TF}s, and to rank expression experiments,
	determining the conditions under which {F}hl1, the factor responsible
	for expression of ribosomal protein genes, is active. {W}e can see
	that targets of {F}hl1 are differentially expressed in the chosen
	conditions as compared to the expression of average and negative
	set genes. {SVM}-based classifiers provide a robust framework for
	analysis of regulatory networks. {P}rocessing of classifier outputs
	can provide high quality predictions and biological insight into

	method will focus on increasing the accuracy and quality of predictions

	it is useful to be able to derive multi-sequence stochastic grammars
	(and hence multiple alignment algorithms) systematically, starting
	from hypotheses about the various kinds of random mutation event
	and their rates. {RESULTS}: {H}ere, we consider a highly simplified
	evolutionary model for {RNA}, called ``{T}he {TKF}91 {S}tructure
	{T}ree'' (following {T}horne, {K}ishino and {F}elsenstein's 1991
	model of sequence evolution with indels), which we have implemented
	for pairwise alignment as proof of principle for such an approach.
	{T}he model, its strengths and its weaknesses are discussed with
	reference to four examples of functional nc{RNA} sequences: a riboswitch
	(guanine), a zipcode (nanos), a splicing factor ({U}4) and a ribozyme
	({RN}ase {P}). {A}s shown by our visualisations of posterior probability

  abstract = {AIMS: To establish the extent of retrograde bile duct infusion at
	an ultrastructural level, as a preliminary step before evaluating
	the efficacy of gene delivery to the rat liver via a branch of the
	bile duct. METHODS: The extent of retrograde infusion into the biliary
	tree was established by light and electron microscopy, following
	infusion of 10 nm gold particles into the right lateral lobe. Canalicular
	permeability was further assessed by the infusion of a 67 kDa protein.
	For gene delivery, both naked DNA and a synthetic peptide vector
	system were evaluated. Because canalicular tight junction permeability
	can be compromised in damaged livers, both normal rats and rats recovering
	from the hepatotoxin D-galactosamine were studied. RESULTS: The gold
	particles penetrated the peripheral one third of the hepatic lobules
	and, surprisingly, reached the space of Disse in normal rats. Equally
	surprisingly, blood levels of a 67 kDa protein were identical after
	bile duct infusion and portal vein injection. Gene delivery with
	peptide/DNA complexes was much more effective in rats treated with
	D-galactosamine. However, gene delivery with naked DNA was equally
	effective in normal and damaged livers. Localisation of gene expression
	showed a scattering of positive hepatocytes restricted to the right
	lateral lobe. CONCLUSIONS: Retrograde infusion into the bile duct
	advances well into the hepatic lobule and reveals a remarkable permeability
	of the canalicular or cholangiole tight junctions in normal rats.
	It is an effective approach for delivering genes to a small population
	(approximately 1\%) of hepatocytes.},

  abstract = {NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2 and CUC2) domain proteins are plant-specific transcriptional
	factors known to play diverse roles in various plant developmental
	processes. NAC transcription factors comprise of a large gene family
	represented by more than 100 members in Arabidopsis, rice and soybean
	etc. Recently, a preliminary phylogenetic analysis was reported for
	NAC gene family from 11 plant species. However, no comprehensive
	study incorporating phylogeny, chromosomal location, gene structure,
	conserved motifs, and expression profiling analysis has been presented
	thus far for the model tree species Populus.In the present study,
	a comprehensive analysis of NAC gene family in Populus was performed.
	A total of 163 full-length NAC genes were identified in Populus,
	and they were phylogenetically clustered into 18 distinct subfamilies.
	The gene structure and motif compositions were considerably conserved
	among the subfamilies. The distributions of 120 Populus NAC genes
	were non-random across the 19 linkage groups (LGs), and 87 genes
	(73\%) were preferentially retained duplicates that located in both
	duplicated regions. The majority of NACs showed specific temporal
	and spatial expression patterns based on EST frequency and microarray
	data analyses. However, the expression patterns of a majority of
	duplicate genes were partially redundant, suggesting the occurrence
	of subfunctionalization during subsequent evolutionary process. Furthermore,
	quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to confirm
	the tissue-specific expression patterns of 25 NAC genes.Based on
	the genomic organizations, we can conclude that segmental duplications
	contribute significantly to the expansion of Populus NAC gene family.
	The comprehensive expression profiles analysis provides first insights
	into the functional divergence among members in NAC gene family.
	In addition, the high divergence rate of expression patterns after
	segmental duplications indicates that NAC genes in Populus are likewise
	to have been retained by substantial subfunctionalization. Taken
	together, our results presented here would be helpful in laying the
	foundation for functional characterization of NAC gene family and
	further gaining an understanding of the structure-function relationship
	between these family members.},

  abstract = {A{BSTRACT}: {BACKGROUND}: {A} number of publications have recently
	examined the occurrence and properties of the feed-forward motif
	in a variety of networks, including those that are of interest in
	genome biology, such as gene networks. {T}he present work looks in
	some detail at the dynamics of the bi-fan motif, using systems of
	ordinary differential equations to model the populations of transcription
	factors, m{RNA} and protein, with the aim of extending our understanding
	of what appear to be important building blocks of gene network structure.
	{RESULTS}: {W}e develop an ordinary differential equation model of
	the bi-fan motif and analyse variants of the motif corresponding
	to its behaviour under various conditions. {I}n particular, we examine
	the effects of different steady and pulsed inputs to five variants
	of the bifan motif, based on evidence in the literature of bifan
	motifs found in {S}accharomyces cerevisiae (commonly known as baker's
	yeast). {U}sing this model, we characterize the dynamical behaviour
	of the bi-fan motif for a wide range of biologically plausible parameters
	and configurations. {W}e find that there is no characteristic behaviour
	for the motif, and with the correct choice of parameters and of internal
	structure, very different, indeed even opposite behaviours may be
	obtained. {CONCLUSIONS}: {E}ven with this relatively simple model,
	the bi-fan motif can exhibit a wide range of dynamical responses.
	{T}his suggests that it is difficult to gain significant insights
	into biological function simply by considering the connection architecture
	of a gene network, or its decomposition into simple structural motifs.
	{I}t is necessary to supplement such structural information by kinetic
	parameters, or dynamic time series experimental data, both of which
	are currently difficult to obtain.},

	{T}he magnitude of the maximal number of transcription factors from

	to study the biochemistry of transcription regulation and chromatin
	dynamics. {C}omputational analysis of viral {DNA}-binding regulatory
	proteins and identification of their previously undetected homologs
	encoded by cellular genomes might lead to a better understanding
	of their function and evolution in both viral and cellular systems.
	{RESULTS}: {T}he phyletic range and the conserved {DNA}-binding domains
	of the viral regulatory proteins of the poxvirus {D}6{R}/{N}1{R}
	and baculoviral {B}ro protein families have not been previously defined.
	{U}sing computational analysis, we show that the amino-terminal module
	of the {D}6{R}/{N}1{R} proteins defines a novel, conserved {DNA}-binding
	domain (the {K}il{A}-{N} domain) that is found in a wide range of
	proteins of large bacterial and eukaryotic {DNA} viruses. {T}he {K}il{A}-{N}
	domain is suggested to be homologous to the fungal {DNA}-binding
	{APSES} domain. {W}e provide evidence for the {K}il{A}-{N} and {APSES}
	domains sharing a common fold with the nucleic acid-binding modules
	of the {LAGLIDADG} nucleases and the amino-terminal domains of the
	t{RNA} endonuclease. {T}he amino-terminal module of the {B}ro proteins
	is another, distinct {DNA}-binding domain (the {B}ro-{N} domain)
	that is present in proteins whose domain architectures parallel those
	of the {K}il{A}-{N} domain-containing proteins. {A} detailed analysis
	of the {K}il{A}-{N} and {B}ro-{N} domains and the associated domains
	points to extensive domain shuffling and lineage-specific gene family

  abstract = {TFs (transcription factors) are modular proteins minimally containing
	a DBD (DNA-binding domain) and a TRD (transcription regulatory domain).
	NAC [for NAM (no apical meristem), ATAF, CUC (cup-shaped cotyledon)]
	proteins comprise one of the largest plant TF families. They are
	key regulators of stress perception and developmental programmes,
	and most share an N-terminal NAC domain. On the basis of analyses
	of gene expression data and the phylogeny of Arabidopsis thaliana
	NAC TFs we systematically decipher structural and functional specificities
	of the conserved NAC domains and the divergent C-termini. Nine of
	the ten NAC domains analysed bind a previously identified conserved
	DNA target sequence with a CGT[GA] core, although with different
	affinities. Likewise, all but one of the NAC proteins analysed is
	dependent on the C-terminal region for transactivational activity.
	In silico analyses show that the NAC TRDs contain group-specific
	sequence motifs and are characterized by a high degree of intrinsic
	disorder. Furthermore, ANAC019 was identified as a new positive regulator
	of ABA (abscisic acid) signalling, conferring ABA hypersensitivity
	when ectopically expressed in plants. Interestingly, ectopic expression
	of the ANAC019 DBD or TRD alone also resulted in ABA hypersensitivity.
	Expression of stress-responsive marker genes [COR47 (cold-responsive
	47), RD29b (responsive-to-desiccation 29b) and ERD11 (early-responsive-to-dehydration
	11)] were also induced by full-length and truncated ANAC019. Domain-swapping
	experiments were used to analyse the specificity of this function.
	Chimaeric proteins, where the NAC domain of ANAC019 was replaced
	with the analogous regions from other NAC TFs, also have the ability
	to positively regulate ABA signalling. In contrast, replacing the
	ANAC019 TRD with other TRDs abolished ANAC019-mediated ABA hypersensitivity.
	In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the biochemical and functional
	specificity of NAC TFs is associated with both the DBDs and the TRDs.},

	{RESULTS}: {W}e present a new method for predicting common {RNA}
	secondary structure motifs in a set of functionally or evolutionarily

	stems (palindromic helices) between sequences and is implemented
	by applying graph-theoretical approaches. {I}t first finds all possible
	stable stems in each sequence and compares stems pairwise between
	sequences by some defined features to find stems conserved across

	it finds all significant stems conserved across at least k sequences.

  volume = {9},
  pages = {284},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Affymetrix high density oligonucleotide expression arrays
	are widely used across all fields of biological research for measuring
	genome-wide gene expression. An important step in processing oligonucleotide
	microarray data is to produce a single value for the gene expression
	level of an RNA transcript using one of a growing number of statistical
	methods. The challenge for the researcher is to decide on the most
	appropriate method to use to address a specific biological question
	with a given dataset. Although several research efforts have focused
	on assessing performance of a few methods in evaluating gene expression
	from RNA hybridization experiments with different datasets, the relative
	merits of the methods currently available in the literature for evaluating
	genome-wide gene expression from Affymetrix microarray data collected
	from real biological experiments remain actively debated. RESULTS:
	The present study reports a comprehensive survey of the performance
	of all seven commonly used methods in evaluating genome-wide gene
	expression from a well-designed experiment using Affymetrix microarrays.
	The experiment profiled eight genetically divergent barley cultivars
	each with three biological replicates. The dataset so obtained confers
	a balanced and idealized structure for the present analysis. The
	methods were evaluated on their sensitivity for detecting differentially
	expressed genes, reproducibility of expression values across replicates,
	and consistency in calling differentially expressed genes. The number
	of genes detected as differentially expressed among methods differed
	by a factor of two or more at a given false discovery rate (FDR)
	level. Moreover, we propose the use of genes containing single feature
	polymorphisms (SFPs) as an empirical test for comparison among methods
	for the ability to detect true differential gene expression on the
	basis that SFPs largely correspond to cis-acting expression regulators.
	The PDNN method demonstrated superiority over all other methods in
	every comparison, whilst the default Affymetrix MAS5.0 method was
	clearly inferior. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive assessment of seven
	commonly used data extraction methods based on an extensive barley
	Affymetrix gene expression dataset has shown that the PDNN method
	has superior performance for the detection of differentially expressed
	genes.},

  abstract = {B{ACKGROUND}: {C}urrent approaches for genome-wise functional analyses,
	such as microarray and {RNA} interference studies, rely on the specificity
	of oligonucleotide sequences to selectively target cellular transcripts.
	{T}he design of specific oligos involves the determination of unique
	{DNA} regions in the gene/transcripts of interest from the targeted
	organism. {T}his process is tedious, time consuming and it does not
	scale up for high-throughput studies. {DESCRIPTION}: {T}aking advantage
	of the availability of complete genome sequence information for mouse
	and human, the most widely used systems for the study of mammalian
	genetics, we have built a database, [{X}]uniq{MAP}, that stores the
	precalculated unique regions for all transcripts of these two organisms.
	{F}or each gene, the database discriminates between those unique
	regions that are shared by all transcripts and those exclusive to
	single transcripts. {I}n addition, it also provides those unique
	regions that are shared between orthologous genes from the two organisms.
	{T}he database is updated regularly to reflect changes in genome
	assemblies and gene builds. {CONCLUSION}: {O}ver 85\% of genes have
	unique regions at least 19 bases long, with the majority being unique
	over 60\% of their lengths. 14482 human genes share exactly at least
	a unique region with mouse genes, though such regions are typically
	under 40 bases long. {T}he full data are publicly accessible online
	both interactively and for download. {T}hey should facilitate (i)
	the design of probes, primers and si{RNA}s for both small- and large-scale
	projects; and (ii) the identification of regions for the design of
	oligos that could be re-used to target equivalent gene/transcripts
	from human and mouse.},

	been studied on a small scale, using classical biochemical methods
	to investigate the proteins of interest. {M}ore recently large-scale
	methods, such as two-hybrid screens, have been utilised to survey
	extensive portions of genomes. {C}urrent high-throughput approaches
	have a relatively high rate of errors, whereas in-depth biochemical
	studies are too expensive and time-consuming to be practical for
	extensive studies. {A}s a result, there are gaps in our knowledge
	of many key biological networks, for which computational approaches
	are particularly suitable. {RESULTS}: {W}e constructed networks,
	or 'interactomes', of putative protein-protein interactions in the
	rat proteome - the rat being an organism extensively used for cancer
	studies. {T}his was achieved by integrating experimental protein-protein
	interaction data from many species and translating this data into
	the reference frame of the rat. {T}he putative rat protein interactions
	were given confidence scores based on their homology to proteins
	that have been experimentally observed to interact. {T}he confidence
	score was furthermore weighted according to the extent of the experimental
	evidence, giving a higher weight to more frequently observed interactions.
	{T}he scoring function was subsequently validated and networks constructed
	around key proteins, identified as being highly up- or down-regulated
	in rat cell lines of high metastatic potential. {U}sing clustering
	methods on the networks, we have identified key protein communities
	involved in cancer metastasis. {CONCLUSIONS}: {T}he protein network
	generation and subsequent network analysis used here, were shown
	to be useful for highlighting key proteins involved in metastasis.
	{T}his approach, in conjunction with microarray expression data,
	can be extended to other species, thereby suggesting possible pathways

  abstract = {B{ACKGROUND}: {T}ranslation initiation in eukaryotes involves the
	recruitment of m{RNA} to the ribosome which is controlled by the
	translation factor e{IF}4{E}. e{IF}4{E} binds to the 5'-m7{G}ppp
	cap-structure of m{RNA}. {T}hree dimensional structures of e{IF}4{E}s
	bound to cap-analogues resemble 'cupped-hands' in which the cap-structure
	is sandwiched between two conserved {T}rp residues ({T}rp-56 and
	{T}rp-102 of {H}. sapiens e{IF}4{E}). {A} third conserved {T}rp residue
	({T}rp-166 of {H}. sapiens e{IF}4{E}) recognizes the 7-methyl moiety
	of the cap-structure. {A}ssessment of {G}en{B}ank {NR} and db{EST}
	databases reveals that many organisms encode a number of proteins
	with homology to e{IF}4{E}. {L}ittle is understood about the relationships
	of these structurally related proteins to each other. {RESULTS}:
	{B}y combining sequence data deposited in the {G}enbank databases,
	we have identified sequences encoding 411 e{IF}4{E}-family members
	from 230 species. {T}hese sequences have been deposited into an internet-accessible
	database designed for sequence comparisons of e{IF}4{E}-family members.
	{M}ost members can be grouped into one of three classes. {C}lass
	{I} members carry {T}rp residues equivalent to {T}rp-43 and {T}rp-56
	of {H}. sapiens e{IF}4{E} and appear to be present in all eukaryotes.
	{C}lass {II} members, possess {T}rp-->{T}yr/{P}he/{L}eu and {T}rp-->{T}yr/{P}he
	substitutions relative to {T}rp-43 and {T}rp-56 of {H}. sapiens e{IF}4{E},
	and can be identified in {M}etazoa, {V}iridiplantae, and {F}ungi.
	{C}lass {III} members possess a {T}rp residue equivalent to {T}rp-43
	of {H}. sapiens e{IF}4{E} but carry a {T}rp-->{C}ys/{T}yr substitution
	relative to {T}rp-56 of {H}. sapiens e{IF}4{E}, and can be identified
	in {C}oelomata and {C}nidaria. {S}ome e{IF}4{E}-family members from
	{P}rotista show extension or compaction relative to prototypical
	e{IF}4{E}-family members. {CONCLUSION}: {T}he expansion of sequenced
	c{DNA}s and genomic {DNA}s from all eukaryotic kingdoms has revealed
	a variety of proteins related in structure to e{IF}4{E}. {E}volutionarily
	it seems that a single early e{IF}4{E} gene has undergone multiple
	gene duplications generating multiple structural classes, such that
	it is no longer possible to predict function from the primary amino
	acid sequence of an e{IF}4{E}-family member. {T}he variety of e{IF}4{E}-family

  volume = {2},
  pages = {18},

  abstract = {B{ACKGROUND}: {P}ower distributions appear in numerous biological,
	physical and other contexts, which appear to be fundamentally different.
	{I}n biology, power laws have been claimed to describe the distributions
	of the connections of enzymes and metabolites in metabolic networks,
	the number of interactions partners of a given protein, the number
	of members in paralogous families, and other quantities. {I}n network
	analysis, power laws imply evolution of the network with preferential
	attachment, i.e. a greater likelihood of nodes being added to pre-existing
	hubs. {E}xploration of different types of evolutionary models in
	an attempt to determine which of them lead to power law distributions
	has the potential of revealing non-trivial aspects of genome evolution.
	{RESULTS}: {A} simple model of evolution of the domain composition
	of proteomes was developed, with the following elementary processes:
	i) domain birth (duplication with divergence), ii) death (inactivation
	and/or deletion), and iii) innovation (emergence from non-coding
	or non-globular sequences or acquisition via horizontal gene transfer).
	{T}his formalism can be described as a birth, death and innovation
	model ({BDIM}). {T}he formulas for equilibrium frequencies of domain
	families of different size and the total number of families at equilibrium
	are derived for a general {BDIM}. {A}ll asymptotics of equilibrium
	frequencies of domain families possible for the given type of models
	are found and their appearance depending on model parameters is investigated.
	{I}t is proved that the power law asymptotics appears if, and only
	if, the model is balanced, i.e. domain duplication and deletion rates
	are asymptotically equal up to the second order. {I}t is further
	proved that any power asymptotic with the degree not equal to -1
	can appear only if the hypothesis of independence of the duplication/deletion
	rates on the size of a domain family is rejected. {S}pecific cases
	of {BDIM}s, namely simple, linear, polynomial and rational models,
	are considered in details and the distributions of the equilibrium
	frequencies of domain families of different size are determined for
	each case. {W}e apply the {BDIM} formalism to the analysis of the
	domain family size distributions in prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteomes
	and show an excellent fit between these empirical data and a particular
	form of the model, the second-order balanced linear {BDIM}. {C}alculation
	of the parameters of these models suggests surprisingly high innovation
	rates, comparable to the total domain birth (duplication) and elimination
	rates, particularly for prokaryotic genomes. {CONCLUSIONS}: {W}e
	show that a straightforward model of genome evolution, which does
	not explicitly include selection, is sufficient to explain the observed
	distributions of domain family sizes, in which power laws appear
	as asymptotic. {H}owever, for the model to be compatible with the
	data, there has to be a precise balance between domain birth, death
	and innovation rates, and this is likely to be maintained by selection.
	{T}he developed approach is oriented at a mathematical description
	of evolution of domain composition of proteomes, but a simple reformulation
	could be applied to models of other evolving networks with preferential
	attachment.},

  abstract = {B{ACKGROUND}: {I}n recent years, model based approaches such as maximum
	likelihood have become the methods of choice for constructing phylogenies.
	{A} number of authors have shown the importance of using adequate
	substitution models in order to produce accurate phylogenies. {I}n
	the past, many empirical models of amino acid substitution have been
	derived using a variety of different methods and protein datasets.
	{T}hese matrices are normally used as surrogates, rather than deriving
	the maximum likelihood model from the dataset being examined. {W}ith
	few exceptions, selection between alternative matrices has been carried
	out in an ad hoc manner. {RESULTS}: {W}e start by highlighting the
	potential dangers of arbitrarily choosing protein models by demonstrating
	an empirical example where a single alignment can produce two topologically
	different and strongly supported phylogenies using two different
	arbitrarily-chosen amino acid substitution models. {W}e demonstrate
	that in simple simulations, statistical methods of model selection
	are indeed robust and likely to be useful for protein model selection.
	{W}e have investigated patterns of amino acid substitution among
	homologous sequences from the three {D}omains of life and our results
	show that no single amino acid matrix is optimal for any of the datasets.
	{P}erhaps most interestingly, we demonstrate that for two large datasets
	derived from the proteobacteria and archaea, one of the most favored
	models in both datasets is a model that was originally derived from
	retroviral {P}ol proteins. {CONCLUSION}: {T}his demonstrates that
	choosing protein models based on their source or method of construction
	may not be appropriate.},

	is a method of large-scale gene expression analysis that has the
	potential to generate the full list of m{RNA}s present within a cell
	population at a given time and their frequency. {A}n essential step
	in {SAGE} library analysis is the unambiguous assignment of each
	14 bp tag to the transcript from which it was derived. {T}his process,
	called tag-to-gene mapping, represents a step that has to be improved
	in the analysis of {SAGE} libraries. {I}ndeed, the existing web sites
	providing correspondence between tags and transcripts do not concern
	all species for which numerous {EST} and c{DNA} have already been
	sequenced. {RESULTS}: {T}his is the reason why we designed and implemented
	a freely available tool called {I}dentitag for tag identification
	that can be used in any species for which transcript sequences are
	available. {I}dentitag is based on a relational database structure
	in order to allow rapid and easy storage and updating of data and,
	most importantly, in order to be able to precisely define identification
	parameters. {T}his structure can be seen like three interconnected
	modules : the first one stores virtual tags extracted from a given
	list of transcript sequences, the second stores experimental tags
	observed in {SAGE} experiments, and the third allows the annotation
	of the transcript sequences used for virtual tag extraction. {I}t
	therefore connects an observed tag to a virtual tag and to the sequence
	it comes from, and then to its functional annotation when available.
	{D}atabases made from different species can be connected according
	to orthology relationship thus allowing the comparison of {SAGE}
	libraries between species. {W}e successfully used {I}dentitag to
	identify tags from our chicken {SAGE} libraries and for chicken to
	human {SAGE} tags interspecies comparison. {I}dentitag sources are
	freely available on http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/identitag/

	for tag identification in any single species and for interspecies

	transcriptomic analysis, an emerging branch of biology.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Constipation is a frequent functional problem
	in children after operation for all types of anorectal malformations.
	Although this has been assumed to be caused by hypomotility of the
	rectosigmoid colon, recent studies have demonstrated generalized
	colonic hypomotility in children with high or intermediate anomalies.
	The cause of this disorder is unknown. The aim of this study was
	to determine whether the observed colonic hypomotility seen in patients
	with anorectal malformations was caused by defects in distribution
	or density of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), recently identified
	as 'intestinal pacemaker cells'. METHODS: Colostomy specimens from
	12 patients with high anorectal anomalies (ARM group; age 0 to 14
	months) were compared with colostomy specimens from five control
	patients with nonmotility-related gastrointestinal pathology (age,
	1 to 4 months). Specimens were immunohistochemically labelled with
	antibodies to PGP9.5, a marker for neural tissue, and antibodies
	to c-kit, a recently characterized marker for interstitial cells
	of Cajal (ICC). RESULTS: Ganglion cells were present in all histological
	specimens. Abnormalities in distribution and density of c-kit-positive
	ICC were present in 7 of 12 ARM patients. In two ARM patients, ICC
	were completely absent, and in five patients, ICC density was markedly
	reduced in circular muscle and at the submucosal border of circular
	muscle. Only five ARM patients had a distribution of ICC similar
	to that of control patients. CONCLUSION: Defects in the population
	of intestinal pacemaker cells may underlie the colonic hypomotility
	seen in high anorectal malformations and hence may contribute to
	refractory constipation.},

	not generally met, and that these simple methods can be improved.
	{RESULTS}: {W}e have developed a robust semi-parametric normalization
	technique based on the assumption that the large majority of genes
	will not have their relative expression levels changed from one treatment
	group to the next, and on the assumption that departures of the response
	from linearity are small and slowly varying. {W}e use local regression
	to estimate the normalized expression levels as well as the expression
	level-dependent error variance. {CONCLUSIONS}: {W}e illustrate the
	use of this technique in a comparison of the expression profiles
	of cultured rat mesothelioma cells under control and under treatment
	with potassium bromate, validated using quantitative {PCR} on a selected
	set of genes. {W}e tested the method using data simulated under various
	error models and find that it performs well.},

	of gene-gene interactions were tested. {T}he results show that the
	frequencies of complex and/or stable patterns depended not only on
	the existence of negative interactions, but also on the distribution
	of regulatory interactions: for example, coregulation of signals
	and their intracellular effectors increased the likelihood of pattern
	formation compared to differential regulation of signaling pathway
	components. {I}nterestingly, neither quantitative differences in
	strengths of signaling interactions nor multiple response thresholds

	were essential for formation of multiple, spatially unique "cell
	types". {H}owever, those combinations of architectural features that
	greatly increased the likelihood for pattern complexity tended to
	decrease the likelihoods for pattern stability and developmental
	robustness. {N}evertheless, elements of complex patterns (e.g. genes,
	cell type order within the pattern) could differ in their developmental
	robustness, which may be important for the evolution of complexity.
	{T}he results show that depending on the network structure, the same
	set of genes can produce patterns of different complexity, robustness
	and stability. {B}ecause of this, the evolution of metazoan complexity

	({PR}) genes because of their physical interaction with the known
	positive regulator, nonexpresser of {PR} gene1 ({NPR}1). {A} triple-knockout
	mutant tga2-1 tga5-1 tga6-1 was shown previously to be defective
	in the induction of {PR} genes and systemic acquired resistance,
	confirming their role in disease resistance. {H}owever, the contributions
	of individual {TGA} factors have been difficult to discern because
	of functional redundancy among these factors, as well as possible
	dual functions for some single factors. {I}n this study, we characterized
	six {TGA} factors by reverse genetics. {W}e show that {TGA}3 is required
	for both basal and 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid-induced transcription
	of {PR} genes. {T}he tga3-1 mutants were found to be defective in
	basal pathogen resistance, whereas induced resistance was unaffected.
	{TGA}1 and {TGA}4 play partially redundant roles in regulation of
	basal resistance, having only moderate effects on {PR} gene expression.
	{A}dditionally, an activation-tagged mutant of {TGA}6 was able to
	increase basal as well as induced expression of {PR}1, demonstrating
	a positive role for {TGA}6 on {PR} gene expression. {I}n contrast,
	{TGA}2 has repressor activity on {PR} gene expression even though

	on the basis of genetic affinity. {W}idely known indica rices correspond
	to group {I} and japonicas to group {VI}. {T}he so called javanica
	rices also belong to group {VI} and are designated as tropical japonicas
	in contrast to temperate japonicas grown in temperate climate. {I}ndica

	{A} {SAGE} library was constructed from 110 microg of total {RNA}
	of normal human choroid/{RPE} tissue, and cloned tag concatemers

	the model a set of secondary structures must be given. {T}he mapping
	is performed by building the preimage of the structures. {F}or this
	purpose, the set of sequences {C} is constructed which are compatible
	with a given structure s. {F}rom this set, sequences are chosen with
	a probability determined by pu and pp, and nally assigned to the
	structure s, if (and only if) this sequence has not been mapped to
	another structure. {T}he properties we are focusing on are the existence
	of extended neutral nets in sequence space, the connectivity of these
	nets and their denseness in {C}. {T}he mathematical theory for our
	model claims the existence of a threshold value for connectivity
	and denseness properties of neutral nets. {T}he theorems hold in
	the limit of in nite chain length and determine the threshold value
	to be p = 1 of the alphabet used to encode the unpaired or paired
	parts of the sequences, respectively. {B}elow this threshold the
	nets are neither connected not dense in {C}, whereas above the threshold
	almost all nets are connected and dense in {C}. {C}omputer experiments
	indicate that a threshold exists also for nite chain length, although
	it is not sharp anymore. {H}owever, within the accuracy of the simulations
	the threshold value is identical with the theoretically predicted
	one. {F}urthermore, it is identical for both properties. {W}e investigate
	the in uence of the tertiary contacts on generic properties of sequence-structure
	mappings. {I}nstead of trying to predict tertiary structures of sequences
	we determine the tertiary contacts. {C}ompatible sequences are then
	constructed according to an arbitrary base-pairing rule. {T}his model
	also contains a tunable parameter determining the frequency of tertiary
	contacts in a structure. {W}e show that in this model large neutral
	networks exist for tertiary structures even in the case where the
	structures contain a relatively high number of tertiary contacts.},

	an ordered set of {A}rabidopsis {RING} domains by evaluating predicted

  abstract = {Despite a recent surge of reports about how micro{RNA}s might regulate
	translation, the question has not been answered. {T}he proposed mechanisms
	contradict one another, and none is supported by strong evidence.
	{T}his review explains some deficiencies in the experiments with
	micro{RNA}s. {S}ome of the problems are traceable to bad habits carried
	over from older studies of translational regulation, here illustrated
	by discussing two models involving m{RNA} binding proteins. {O}ne
	widely-accepted model, called into doubt by recent findings, is the
	maskin hypothesis for translational repression of cyclin {B}1 in
	{X}enopus oocytes. {T}he second dubious model postulates repression
	of translation of ceruloplasmin by m{RNA} binding proteins. {A} big
	fault in the latter case is reconstructing the imagined mechanism
	before looking carefully at the real thing-a criticism that applies
	also to studies with micro{RNA}s. {E}xperiments with micro{RNA}s
	often employ internal ribosome entry sequences ({IRES}s) as tools,
	necessitating brief discussion of that topic. {A} sensitive new assay
	reveals that many putative {IRES}s promote expression of downstream
	cistrons via splicing rather than internal initiation of translation.
	{R}ecent claims about the biological importance of {IRES}-binding
	proteins-including suggestions that these proteins might serve as
	targets for cancer therapy-are not supported by any meaningful evidence.
	{T}he bottom line is that older studies of m{RNA} binding proteins
	and putative {IRES}s have created a confusing picture of translational
	regulation which is not helpful when trying to understand how micro{RNA}s
	might work. {T}he obvious biological importance of micro{RNA}s makes

	modeling, database searching and multiple sequence alignment of protein
	families and protein domains. These methods are demonstrated on the
	globin family, the protein kinase catalytic domain, and the EF-hand
	calcium binding motif. In each case the parameters of an HMM are
	estimated from a training set of unaligned sequences. After the HMM
	is built, it is used to obtain a multiple alignment of all the training
	sequences. It is also used to search the SWISS-PROT 22 database for
	other sequences that are members of the given protein family, or
	contain the given domain. The HMM produces multiple alignments of
	good quality that agree closely with the alignments produced by programs
	that incorporate three-dimensional structural information. When employed
	in discrimination tests (by examining how closely the sequences in
	a database fit the globin, kinase and EF-hand HMMs), the HMM is able
	to distinguish members of these families from non-members with a
	high degree of accuracy. Both the HMM and PROFILESEARCH (a technique
	used to search for relationships between a protein sequence and multiply
	aligned sequences) perform better in these tests than PROSITE (a
	dictionary of sites and patterns in proteins). The HMM appears to
	have a slight advantage over PROFILESEARCH in terms of lower rates
	of false negatives and false positives, even though the HMM is trained
	using only unaligned sequences, whereas PROFILESEARCH requires aligned
	training sequences. Our results suggest the presence of an EF-hand
	calcium binding motif in a highly conserved and evolutionary preserved
	putative intracellular region of 155 residues in the alpha-1 subunit
	of L-type calcium channels which play an important role in excitation-contraction
	coupling. This region has been suggested to contain the functional
	domains that are typical or essential for all L-type calcium channels

	oscillations of the corresponding distributions are thought to be
	of functional importance. {H}ere, a theoretical approach toward an

	to be sufficient for generating oscillations: first, a tendency of

	detachment from the cell wall, which depends on the amount of molecules
	already attached. {T}he model is in qualitative agreement with the

  abstract = {The {A}tf1 transcription factor plays a vital role in the ability
	of {S}chizosaccharomyces pombe cells to respond to various stress
	conditions. {I}t regulates the expression of many genes in a stress-dependent
	manner, and its function is dependent upon the stress-activated {MAPK},
	{S}ty1/{S}pc1. {M}oreover, {A}tf1 is directly phosphorylated by {S}ty1.
	{H}ere we have investigated the role of such phosphorylation. {A}tf1
	protein accumulates following stress, and this accumulation is lost
	in a strain defective in the {S}ty1 signaling pathway. {I}n addition,
	accumulation of a mutant {A}tf1 protein that can no longer be phosphorylated
	is lost. {M}easurement of the half-life of {A}tf1 demonstrates that
	changes in {A}tf1 stability are responsible for this accumulation.
	{A}tf1 stability is also regulated by its heterodimeric partner,
	{P}cr1. {S}imilarly, {P}cr1 levels are regulated by {A}tf1. {T}hus
	multiple pathways exist that ensure that {A}tf1 levels are appropriately
	regulated. {P}hosphorylation of {A}tf1 is important for cells to
	mount a robust response to {H}(2){O}(2) stress, because the {A}tf1
	phospho-mutant displays sensitivity to this stress, and induction
	of gene expression is lower than that observed in wild-type cells.
	{S}urprisingly, however, loss of {A}tf1 phosphorylation does not
	lead to the complete loss of stress-activated expression of {A}tf1
	target genes. {A}ccordingly, the {A}tf1 phospho-mutant does not display
	the same overall stress sensitivities as the atf1 deletion mutant.
	{T}aken together, these data suggest that {S}ty1 phosphorylation
	of {A}tf1 is not required for activation of {A}tf1 per se but rather
	for modulating its stability.},

	a single ("lone") base-pair capped by a hairpin loop containing three
	nucleotides. {T}he two nucleotides immediately outside of this motif
	(5' and 3' to the lonepair) are not base-paired to one another, restricting
	the length of this helix to a single base-pair. {F}our examples of
	this motif, along with three tentative examples, were initially identified
	in the 16{S} and 23{S} r{RNA}s with covariation analysis. {A}n evaluation
	of the recently determined crystal structures of the {T}hermus thermophilus
	30{S} and {H}aloarcula marismortui 50{S} ribosomal subunits revealed
	the authenticity for all of these proposed interactions and identified
	16 more {LPTL}s in the 5{S}, 16{S} and 23{S} r{RNA}s. {T}his motif
	is found in the {T} loop in the t{RNA} crystal structures. {T}he
	lonepairs are positioned, in nearly all examples, immediately 3'
	to a regular secondary structure helix and are stabilized by coaxial
	stacking onto this flanking helix. {I}n all but two cases, the nucleotides
	in the triloop are involved in a tertiary interaction with another
	section of the r{RNA}, establishing an overall three-dimensional
	function for this motif. {O}f these 24 examples, 14 occur in multi-stem
	loops, seven in hairpin loops and three in internal loops. {W}hile
	the most common lonepair, {U}:{A}, occurs in ten of the 24 {LPTL}s,
	the remaining 14 {LPTL}s contain seven different base-pair types.
	{O}nly a few of these lonepairs adopt the standard {W}atson-{C}rick
	base-pair conformations, while the majority of the base-pairs have
	non-standard conformations. {W}hile the general three-dimensional
	conformation is similar for all examples of this motif, characteristic
	differences lead to several subtypes present in different structural
	environments. {A}t least one triloop nucleotide in 22 of the 24 {LPTL}s
	in the r{RNA}s and t{RNA}s forms a tertiary interaction with another
	part of the {RNA}. {W}hen a {LPTL} containing the {GNR} or {UYR}
	triloop sequence forms a tertiary interaction with the first (and
	second) triloop nucleotide, it recruits a fourth nucleotide to mediate
	stacking and mimic the tetraloop conformation. {A}pproximately half
	of the {LPTL} motifs are in close association with proteins. {T}he
	majority of these {LPTL}s are positioned at sites in r{RNA}s that
	are conserved in the three phylogenetic domains; a few of these occur
	in regions of the r{RNA} associated with ribosomal function, including
	the presumed site of peptidyl transferase activity in the 23{S} r{RNA}.},

	patterns in gene expression data. All these methods try to find some
	type of biclusters but no one can discover all the types of patterns
	in the data. Furthermore, researchers have to design new algorithms
	in order to find new types of biclusters/patterns that interest biologists.
	In this paper, we propose a novel approach for biclustering that,
	in general, can be used to discover all computable patterns in gene
	expression data. The method is based on the theory of Kolmogorov
	complexity. More precisely, we use Kolmogorov complexity to measure
	the randomness of submatrices as the merit of biclusters because
	randomness naturally consists in a lack of regularity, which is a
	common property of all types of patterns. On the basis of algorithmic
	probability measure, we develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm
	to search for biclusters. Our method can also be easily extended
	to solve the problems of conventional clustering and checkerboard
	type biclustering. The preliminary experiments on simulated as well
	as real data show that our approach is very versatile and promising.},

	{W}ith this definition, scale-free (or its opposite, scale-rich)
	is closely related to other structural graph properties such as various
	notions of self-similarity (or respectively, self-dissimilarity).
	{S}cale-free graphs are also shown to be the likely outcome of random

	anterior-posterior patterning. {W}e find that these sequence-specific
	{DNA} binding proteins bind with quantitatively different specificities
	to highly overlapping sets of several thousand genomic regions in
	blastoderm embryos. {S}pecific high- and moderate-affinity in vitro
	recognition sequences for each factor are enriched in bound regions.
	{T}his enrichment, however, is not sufficient to explain the pattern
	of binding in vivo and varies in a context-dependent manner, demonstrating
	that higher-order rules must govern targeting of transcription factors.
	{T}he more highly bound regions include all of the over 40 well-characterized
	enhancers known to respond to these factors as well as several hundred
	putative new cis-regulatory modules clustered near developmental
	regulators and other genes with patterned expression at this stage

  abstract = {B{ACKGROUND}: {M}any biological networks show some characteristics
	of scale-free networks. {S}cale-free networks can evolve through
	preferential attachment where new nodes are preferentially attached
	to well connected nodes. {I}n networks which have evolved through
	preferential attachment older nodes should have a higher average
	connectivity than younger nodes. {H}ere we have investigated preferential
	attachment in the context of metabolic networks. {RESULTS}: {T}he
	connectivities of the enzymes in the metabolic network of {E}scherichia
	coli were determined and representatives for these enzymes were located
	in 11 eukaryotes, 17 archaea and 46 bacteria. {E}. coli enzymes which
	have representatives in eukaryotes have a higher average connectivity
	while enzymes which are represented only in the prokaryotes, and
	especially the enzymes only present in beta/gamma-proteobacteria,
	have lower connectivities than expected by chance. {I}nterestingly,
	the enzymes which have been proposed as candidates for horizontal
	gene transfer have a higher average connectivity than the other enzymes.
	{F}urthermore, new edges are added to the highly connected enzymes
	at a faster rate than to enzymes with low connectivities which is
	consistent with preferential attachment. {CONCLUSIONS}: {H}ere, we
	have found indications of preferential attachment in the metabolic
	network of {E}. coli. {A} possible biological explanation for preferential
	attachment growth of metabolic networks is that novel enzymes created
	through gene duplication maintain some of the compounds involved
	in the original reaction, throughout its future evolution. {I}n addition,
	we found that enzymes which are candidates for horizontal gene transfer
	have a higher average connectivity than other enzymes. {T}his indicates
	that while new enzymes are attached preferentially to highly connected
	enzymes, these highly connected enzymes have sometimes been introduced
	into the {E}. coli genome by horizontal gene transfer. {W}e speculate
	that {E}. coli has adjusted its metabolic network to a changing environment
	by replacing the relatively central enzymes for better adapted orthologs
	from other prokaryotic species.},

	completed genome sequences of rice and {A}rabidopsis constitute a

	analysis of a complete collection of the 36-reported {A}rabidopsis
	thaliana and the rice {D}of transcription factors identified herein.
	{T}his analysis led to a classification into four major clusters

	portion of the genome has been segmentally duplicated, giving rise

	rice genome in which segmental duplication has been documented has
	allowed us to investigate intron evolution within rice, a diploid
	monocotyledonous species. {RESULTS} : {A}nalysis of segmental duplication
	in rice revealed that 159 {M}b of the 371 {M}b genome and 21,570
	of the 43,719 non-transposable element-related genes were contained
	within a duplicated region. {I}n these duplicated regions, 3,101

  abstract = {B{ACKGROUND}: {M}any complex random networks have been found to be

	considered potential false positive and false negative links in the
	observed networks, especially in biological networks inferred from
	high-throughput experiments. {T}herefore, it is important to study
	the impact of these measurement errors on the topology of the observed
	networks. {RESULTS}: {T}his article addresses the impact of erroneous
	links on network topological inference and explores possible error
	mechanisms for scale-free networks with an emphasis on {S}accharomyces
	cerevisiae protein interaction networks. {W}e study this issue by
	both theoretical derivations and simulations. {W}e show that the
	ignorance of erroneous links in network analysis may lead to biased
	estimates of the scale parameter and recommend robust estimators
	in such scenarios. {P}ossible error mechanisms of yeast protein interaction
	networks are explored by comparisons between real data and simulated
	data. {CONCLUSION}: {O}ur studies show that, in the presence of erroneous
	links, the connectivity distribution of scale-free networks is still
	scale-free for the middle range connectivities, but can be greatly
	distorted for low and high connecitivities. {I}t is more appropriate
	to use robust estimators such as the least trimmed mean squares estimator
	to estimate the scale parameter gamma under such circumstances. {M}oreover,
	we show by simulation studies that the scale-free property is robust
	to some error mechanisms but untenable to others. {T}he simulation
	results also suggest that different error mechanisms may be operating
	in the yeast protein interaction networks produced from different
	data sources. {I}n the {MIPS} gold standard protein interaction data,
	there appears to be a high rate of false negative links, and the
	false negative and false positive rates are more or less constant
	across proteins with different connectivities. {H}owever, the error
	mechanism of yeast two-hybrid data may be very different, where the
	overall false negative rate is low and the false negative rates tend
	to be higher for links involving proteins with more interacting partners.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Recent advances have raised the possibility of
	treating enteric nervous system (ENS) disorders with transplanted
	progenitor cells (ENSPC). Although these cells have been shown to
	migrate and differentiate after transplantation, no functional effects
	have been demonstrated. We therefore aimed to investigate whether
	embryonic mouse and neonatal human ENSPC can regulate the contractility
	of aganglionic bowel. METHODS: Embryonic mouse and neonatal human
	ENSPC were grown as neurospheres before transplantation into aganglionic
	embryonic mouse hindgut explants and culture for 8-12 days. Engraftment
	and neural differentiation were confirmed using immunofluorescence
	and transmission electron microscopy. The contraction frequency of
	transplanted bowel was measured and compared with that of embryonic
	day 11.5 embryonic ganglionic and aganglionic bowel cultured for
	the same period. Calcium movement was measured at spatially defined
	points in bowel wall smooth muscle. Neural modulation of bowel contractility
	was assessed using tetrodotoxin. RESULTS: Both mouse and human ENSPC
	migrated and differentiated after neurosphere transplantation. Transmission
	electron microscopy demonstrated the existence of synapses. Transplantation
	restored the high contraction frequency of aganglionic bowel to the
	lower rate of ganglionic bowel. Calcium imaging demonstrated that
	neurosphere transplantation coordinates intracellular free calcium
	levels. Both these effects were reversed by the addition of tetrodotoxin,
	indicating the functional effect of neurosphere-derived neurons.
	CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal human gut is a source of ENSPC that can be
	transplanted to restore the contractile properties of aganglionic
	bowel by a neurally mediated mechanism. This may aid development
	of a stem cell-based treatment for Hirschsprung's disease.},

  abstract = {Spasticity is relatively common among children with cerebral palsy.
	This condition can be painful, can severely impair a child's ability
	to perform basic tasks, and can place an enormous emotional and financial
	burden on the family. Intrathecal baclofen delivered via an implantable
	pump is an effective treatment option for children unresponsive to
	oral medication and needing generalized motor control. However, the
	initial investment for the delivery device and its surgical placement
	can be a barrier to access. A cost-effectiveness analysis of intrathecal
	baclofen for adults in the British health care system concluded that
	intrathecal baclofen offered good value for the money. No similar
	analysis of intrathecal baclofen has been conducted in the context
	of the US health care system, and no study has specifically examined
	cost-effectiveness of intrathecal baclofen in a pediatric population.
	The aim of this article is to assess the cost-effectiveness of intrathecal
	baclofen among children with severe spasticity of cerebral origin
	who have not responded to less invasive treatments such as oral medications
	relative to alternative medical and surgical therapy. The authors
	used mathematical modeling and computer simulation to estimate the
	incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year for identical cohorts
	of children treated with intrathecal baclofen or alternative therapy
	over a 5-year episode of treatment. Data on treatment costs representative
	of these children were derived from a health insurance claims database
	that included both commercial and Medicaid data. Utility values used
	to construct quality-adjusted life-years were obtained from a panel
	of expert clinicians who used the Health Utilities Index-2 to rate
	health states associated with the course of treatment. On average,
	intrathecal baclofen therapy increased the 5-year cost of treatment
	by $49 000 relative to alternative treatment. However, this was accompanied
	by an average gain of 1.2 quality-adjusted life-years. The net result
	was an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $42 000 per quality-adjusted
	life-year, a figure well within the $50 000 to $100 000 range that
	is widely accepted as offering good value for the money.},

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {10 Suppl 4},
  pages = {S9},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput microarray technologies have generated
	and accumulated massive amounts of gene expression datasets that
	contain expression levels of thousands of genes under hundreds of
	different experimental conditions. The microarray datasets are usually
	presented in 2D matrices, where rows represent genes and columns
	represent experimental conditions. The analysis of such datasets
	can discover local structures composed by sets of genes that show
	coherent expression patterns under subsets of experimental conditions.
	It leads to the development of sophisticated algorithms capable of
	extracting novel and useful knowledge from a biomedical point of
	view. In the medical domain, these patterns are useful for understanding
	various diseases, and aid in more accurate diagnosis, prognosis,
	treatment planning, as well as drug discovery. RESULTS: In this work
	we present the CMOPSOB (Crowding distance based Multi-objective Particle
	Swarm Optimization Biclustering), a novel clustering approach for
	microarray datasets to cluster genes and conditions highly related
	in sub-portions of the microarray data. The objective of biclustering
	is to find sub-matrices, i.e. maximal subgroups of genes and subgroups
	of conditions where the genes exhibit highly correlated activities
	over a subset of conditions. Since these objectives are mutually
	conflicting, they become suitable candidates for multi-objective
	modelling. Our approach CMOPSOB is based on a heuristic search technique,
	multi-objective particle swarm optimization, which simulates the
	movements of a flock of birds which aim to find food. In the meantime,
	the nearest neighbour search strategies based on crowding distance
	and -dominance can rapidly converge to the Pareto front and guarantee
	diversity of solutions. We compare the potential of this methodology
	with other biclustering algorithms by analyzing two common and public
	datasets of gene expression profiles. In all cases our method can
	find localized structures related to sets of genes that show consistent
	expression patterns across subsets of experimental conditions. The
	mined patterns present a significant biological relevance in terms
	of related biological processes, components and molecular functions
	in a species-independent manner. CONCLUSION: The proposed CMOPSOB
	algorithm is successfully applied to biclustering of microarray dataset.
	It achieves a good diversity in the obtained Pareto front, and rapid
	convergence. Therefore, it is a useful tool to analyze large microarray
	datasets.},

	has been made in {RNA} motif finding and structure alignment. {H}owever,
	existing tools either require a large number of prealigned structures
	or suffer from high time complexities. {T}his makes it difficult
	for the tools to process {RNA}s whose prealigned structures are unavailable
	or process very large {RNA} structure databases. {RESULTS}: {W}e
	present here an efficient tool called {RS}match for aligning {RNA}
	secondary structures and for motif detection. {M}otivated by widely
	used algorithms for {RNA} folding, we decompose an {RNA} secondary
	structure into a set of atomic structure components that are further
	organized by a tree model to capture the structural particularities.
	{RS}match can find the optimal global and local alignment between
	two {RNA} secondary structures using two scoring matrices, one for
	single-stranded regions and the other for double-stranded regions.
	{T}he time complexity of {RS}match is {O}(mn) where m is the size
	of the query structure and n that of the subject structure. {W}hen
	applied to searching a structure database, {RS}match can find similar
	{RNA} substructures, and is capable of conducting multiple structure
	alignment and iterative database search. {T}herefore it can be used
	to identify functional {RNA} motifs. {T}he accuracy of {RS}match
	is tested by experiments using a number of known {RNA} structures,
	including simple stem loops and complex structures containing junctions.
	{CONCLUSIONS}: {W}ith respect to computing efficiency and accuracy,
	{RS}match compares favorably with other tools for {RNA} structure
	alignment and motif detection. {T}his tool shall be useful to researchers

	trees has come to the fore of phylogenetics, only recently have methods
	been developed that explicitly estimate species trees. Of the several
	factors that can cause gene tree heterogeneity and discordance with
	the species tree, deep coalescence due to random genetic drift in
	branches of the species tree has been modeled most thoroughly. Bayesian
	approaches to estimating species trees utilizes two likelihood functions,
	one of which has been widely used in traditional phylogenetics and
	involves the model of nucleotide substitution, and the second of
	which is less familiar to phylogeneticists and involves the probability
	distribution of gene trees given a species tree. Other recent parametric
	and nonparametric methods for estimating species trees involve parsimony
	criteria, summary statistics, supertree and consensus methods. Species
	tree approaches are an appropriate goal for systematics, appear to
	work well in some cases where concatenation can be misleading, and
	suggest that sampling many independent loci will be paramount. Such
	methods can also be challenging to implement because of the complexity
	of the models and computational time. In addition, further elaboration

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Even after years of exploration, the terrestrial origin
	of bio-molecules remains unsolved and controversial. Today, observation
	of amino acid composition in proteins has become an alternative way
	for a global understanding of the mystery encoded in whole genomes
	and seeking clues for the origin of amino acids. RESULTS: In this
	study, we statistically monitored the frequencies of 20 alpha-amino
	acids in 549 taxa from three kingdoms of life: archaebacteria, eubacteria,
	and eukaryotes. We found that the amino acids evolved independently
	in these three kingdoms; but, conserved linkages were observed in
	two groups of amino acids, (A, G, H, L, P, Q, R, and W) and (F, I,
	K, N, S, and Y). Moreover, the amino acids encoded by GC-poor codons
	(F, Y, N, K, I, and M) were found to "lose" their usage in the development
	from single cell eukaryotic organisms like S. cerevisiae to H. sapiens,
	while the amino acids encoded by GC-rich codons (P, A, G, and W)
	were found to gain usage. These findings further support the co-evolution
	hypothesis of amino acids and genetic codes. CONCLUSION: We proposed
	a new chronological order of the appearance of amino acids (L, A,
	V/E/G, S, I, K, T, R/D, P, N, F, Q, Y, M, H, W, C). Two conserved
	evolutionary paths of amino acids were also suggested: A-->G-->R-->P

	with existing yeast one-hybrid systems, which use yeast transformation
	for the library screen. {RESULTS} : {H}ere we propose an adaptation
	of the yeast one-hybrid system for identification and cloning of
	transcription factors using a {MATCHMAKER} c{DNA} library. {T}he
	procedure is demonstrated using a c{DNA} library prepared from the
	liquid part of the multinucleate coenocyte of wheat endosperm. {T}he
	method is a modification of a standard one-hybrid screening protocol,
	utilising a mating step to introduce the library construct and reporter
	construct into the same cell. {S}everal novel full length transcription
	factors from the homeodomain, {AP}2 domain and {E}2{F} families of
	transcription factors were identified and isolated. {CONCLUSION}
	: {I}n this paper we propose a method to extend the compatibility
	of {MATCHMAKER} c{DNA} libraries from yeast two-hybrid screens to
	one-hybrid screens. {T}he utility of the new yeast one-hybrid technology
	is demonstrated by the successful cloning from wheat of full-length

	across seed plants, with a special focus on angiosperms. {P}enalized

	hypothesis for seed plants derived from {B}ayesian analysis, with
	branch lengths estimated with maximum likelihood. {T}he plastid genes

	combination, using first and second, third, and the three codon positions,
	including and excluding age constraints on 20 nodes derived from
	a critical examination of the land-plant fossil record. {T}he optimal
	level of rate smoothing according to each unconstrained and constrained
	dataset was obtained with penalized likelihood. {T}ests for a molecular

	of fossil constraints resulted in even greater departures from constancy.
	{C}onsistently with significant deviations from a clock, estimated

	estimates for nodes across the phylogeny varied, sometimes substantially,

	estimates are more variable than constrained estimates and are frequently
	younger than well-substantiated fossil members of the clade. {C}onstrained

	design. {RESULTS}: {W}e have developed an open-source {GPHMM} gene
	finder, {TWAIN}, which performs very well on two related {A}spergillus
	species, {A}. fumigatus and {A}. nidulans, finding 89\% of the exons
	and predicting 74\% of the gene models exactly correctly in a test
	set of 147 conserved gene pairs. {W}e describe the implementation
	of this {GPHMM} and we explicitly address the assumptions and limitations

	present study describes a {G}lobal {E}rror {A}ssessment ({GEA}) methodology
	to select differentially expressed genes in microarray datasets,
	and was developed using an in vitro experiment that compared control
	and interferon-gamma treated skin cells. {I}n this experiment, up

	biological data (such as protein/gene function) stored in databases
	have not been overly successful. There are several hypotheses on
	why this has not been successful but it is not clear which of these
	hypotheses are correct. In this study we have surveyed 50 biologists
	(who have recently published a paper characterizing a gene or protein)
	to better understand what would make them interested in providing
	input/contributions to biological databases. Based on our survey
	two things become clear: a) database managers need to proactively
	contact biologists to solicit contributions; and b) potential contributors
	need to be provided with an easy-to-use interface and clear instructions
	on what to annotate. Other factors such as 'reward' and 'employer/funding
	agency recognition' previously perceived as motivators was found
	to be less important. Based on this study we propose community annotation
	projects should devote resources to direct solicitation for input
	and streamlining of the processes or interfaces used to collect this
	input. Reviewers: This article was reviewed by I. King Jordan, Daniel

	sheep. Juvenile flukes were recovered from each of the sheeps' liver
	and processed for examination by electron microscopy. The surface
	morphology of the flukes' tegument was assessed using scanning electron
	microscopy (SEM). The ultrastructure of the tegumental syncytium
	and underlying tegumental cells and connections and somatic musculature
	were investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both
	the SEM and TEM results revealed a level of disruption that increased
	with time, culminating at 72h with extensive tegumental loss and
	substantial degeneration of the cell bodies. The effects of compound
	alpha on the surface morphology were not particularly apparent until
	48h post-treatment, when disruption included swelling and blebbing
	of the tegument. At 72h post-treatment, SEM revealed loss of the
	entire syncytial layer over large areas of the flukes. In the areas
	where the syncytium was lost and the basal lamina exposed, lesions
	of varying sizes had developed, revealing underlying tissues. Though
	minor forms of disruption to the ultrastructure of the syncytium

	that substantial stress responses occurred. They included the presence
	of autophagic vacuoles and 'open' bodies at the apex of the syncytium
	and swelling of the basal infolds. The mitochondria within the syncytium
	and tegumental cells became progressively more disrupted over the
	three time periods and, by 72h post-treatment, they were frequently
	distorted and swollen in appearance, and contained severely swollen
	cristae. By 72h, the number of secretory bodies, particularly T1
	bodies, had become significantly depleted in their respective cell
	bodies, cytoplasmic processes and in the tegumental syncytium. Both
	the circular and longitudinal muscle bundles were severely disrupted
	72h post-treatment. They frequently contained a reduced number of
	muscle fibres and, in more severe instances, there was an absence

	disease attending for jejunal biopsy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnosis
	of coeliac disease with the revised criteria of the European Society
	of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition in patients with and
	without antibodies associated with coeliac disease. RESULTS: 28 patients
	had a clinical diagnosis of coeliac disease, seven of other gastrointestinal

	Gliadin IgA detected by ELISA was found in all patients with coeliac
	disease and none of those without, giving a sensitivity, specificity,

	data and whether or not there is any correlation between this grouping
	and the biological function of the gene. {RESULTS}: {U}sing {P}ro{S}pector,
	a web-based promoter search and annotation tool, we have applied
	an unbiased approach to analyze the transcription factor binding
	site frequencies of 1400 base pair genomic segments positioned at
	1200 base pairs upstream and 200 base pairs downstream of the transcriptional
	start site of 7298 commonly studied human genes. {P}artitional clustering
	of the transcription factor binding site composition within these
	promoter segments reveals a small number of gene groups that are
	selectively enriched for gene ontology terms consistent with distinct
	aspects of cellular function. {S}ignificance ranking of the class-determining
	transcription factor binding sites within these clusters show substantial
	overlap between the gene ontology terms of the transcriptions factors
	associated with the binding sites and the gene ontology terms of
	the regulated genes within each group. {CONCLUSION}: {T}hus, gene
	sorting by promoter composition alone produces partitions in which
	the "regulated" and the "regulators" cosegregate into similar functional
	classes. {T}hese findings demonstrate that the transcription factor
	binding site composition is non-randomly distributed between gene
	promoters in a manner that reflects and partially defines general

  abstract = {B{ACKGROUND}: {K}ernel-based learning algorithms are among the most
	advanced machine learning methods and have been successfully applied
	to a variety of sequence classification tasks within the field of
	bioinformatics. {C}onventional kernels utilized so far do not provide
	an easy interpretation of the learnt representations in terms of
	positional and compositional variability of the underlying biological
	signals. {RESULTS}: {W}e propose a kernel-based approach to datamining
	on biological sequences. {W}ith our method it is possible to model
	and analyze positional variability of oligomers of any length in
	a natural way. {O}n one hand this is achieved by mapping the sequences
	to an intuitive but high-dimensional feature space, well-suited for
	interpretation of the learnt models. {O}n the other hand, by means
	of the kernel trick we can provide a general learning algorithm for
	that high-dimensional representation because all required statistics
	can be computed without performing an explicit feature space mapping
	of the sequences. {B}y introducing a kernel parameter that controls
	the degree of position-dependency, our feature space representation
	can be tailored to the characteristics of the biological problem
	at hand. {A} regularized learning scheme enables application even
	to biological problems for which only small sets of example sequences
	are available. {O}ur approach includes a visualization method for
	transparent representation of characteristic sequence features. {T}hereby
	importance of features can be measured in terms of discriminative
	strength with respect to classification of the underlying sequences.
	{T}o demonstrate and validate our concept on a biochemically well-defined
	case, we analyze {E}. coli translation initiation sites in order
	to show that we can find biologically relevant signals. {F}or that
	case, our results clearly show that the {S}hine-{D}algarno sequence
	is the most important signal upstream a start codon. {T}he variability
	in position and composition we found for that signal is in accordance
	with previous biological knowledge. {W}e also find evidence for signals
	downstream of the start codon, previously introduced as transcriptional
	enhancers. {T}hese signals are mainly characterized by occurrences
	of adenine in a region of about 4 nucleotides next to the start codon.
	{CONCLUSIONS}: {W}e showed that the oligo kernel can provide a valuable
	tool for the analysis of relevant signals in biological sequences.
	{I}n the case of translation initiation sites we could clearly deduce
	the most discriminative motifs and their positional variation from
	example sequences. {A}ttractive features of our approach are its
	flexibility with respect to oligomer length and position conservation.
	{B}y means of these two parameters oligo kernels can easily be adapted
	to different biological problems.},

	in {DNA}, in particular single nucleotide polymorphism, using padlock
	probes and rolling circle replication are presented. {DNA} probes
	that can be circularized padlock probes are ideal for rolling circle
	replication. {C}ircularized, but not unreacted probes, can generate
	powerful signal amplification by allowing the reacted probes to template
	a rolling circle replication ({RCR}) reaction. {H}owever, when hybridized
	and ligated to a target {DNA} molecule with no nearby ends, the probes
	are bound to the target sequence, inhibiting the {RCR} reaction is.
	{T}his problem can be solved by generating a branched {DNA} probe
	with two 3 arms such that the probes may be circularized while leaving
	the second 3 arm as a primer for the {RCR} reaction. {W}e describe
	how {T}4 {DNA} ligase can be used for efficient construction of {DNA}

  abstract = {D{NA} barcoding has attracted attention with promises to aid in species
	identification and discovery; however, few well-sampled datasets
	are available to test its performance. {W}e provide the first examination
	of barcoding performance in a comprehensively sampled, diverse group
	(cypraeid marine gastropods, or cowries). {W}e utilize previous methods
	for testing performance and employ a novel phylogenetic approach
	to calculate intraspecific variation and interspecific divergence.
	{E}rror rates are estimated for (1) identifying samples against a
	well-characterized phylogeny, and (2) assisting in species discovery
	for partially known groups. {W}e find that the lowest overall error
	for species identification is 4\%. {I}n contrast, barcoding performs
	poorly in incompletely sampled groups. {H}ere, species delineation
	relies on the use of thresholds, set to differentiate between intraspecific
	variation and interspecific divergence. {W}hereas proponents envision
	a "barcoding gap" between the two, we find substantial overlap, leading
	to minimal error rates of approximately 17\% in cowries. {M}oreover,
	error rates double if only traditionally recognized species are analyzed.
	{T}hus, {DNA} barcoding holds promise for identification in taxonomically
	well-understood and thoroughly sampled clades. {H}owever, the use
	of thresholds does not bode well for delineating closely related
	species in taxonomically understudied groups. {T}he promise of barcoding
	will be realized only if based on solid taxonomic foundations.},

	fold a completely synthesized {RNA} molecule. {H}owever, within the
	cell, {RNA} molecules emerge sequentially during the directed process
	of transcription. {D}edicated experiments with individual {RNA} molecules
	have shown that {RNA} folds while it is being transcribed and that
	its correct folding can also depend on the proper speed of transcription.
	{METHODS}: {T}he main aim of this work is to study if and how co-transcriptional
	folding is encoded within the primary and secondary structure of
	{RNA} genes. {I}n order to achieve this, we study the known primary
	and secondary structures of a comprehensive data set of 361 {RNA}
	genes as well as a set of 48 {RNA} sequences that are known to differ
	from the originally transcribed sequence units. {W}e detect co-transcriptional
	folding by defining two measures of directedness which quantify the
	extend of asymmetry between alternative helices that lie 5' and those
	that lie 3' of the known helices with which they compete. {RESULTS}:
	{W}e show with statistical significance that co-transcriptional folding
	strongly influences {RNA} sequences in two ways: (1) alternative
	helices that would compete with the formation of the functional structure
	during co-transcriptional folding are suppressed and (2) the formation
	of transient structures which may serve as guidelines for the co-transcriptional
	folding pathway is encouraged. {CONCLUSIONS}: {T}hese findings have
	a number of implications for {RNA} secondary structure prediction
	methods and the detection of {RNA} genes.},

  abstract = {Individuality is a complex trait, yet a series of stages each advantageous
	in itself can be shown to exist allowing evolution to get from unicellular
	individuals to multicellular individuals. {W}e consider several of
	the key stages involved in this transition: the initial advantage
	of group formation, the origin of reproductive altruism within the
	group, and the further specialization of cell types as groups increase
	in size. {H}ow do groups become individuals? {T}his is the central
	question we address. {O}ur hypothesis is that fitness tradeoffs drive
	the transition of a cell group into a multicellular individual through
	the evolution of cells specialized at reproductive and vegetative
	functions of the group. {W}e have modeled this hypothesis and have
	tested our models in two ways. {W}e have studied the origin of the
	genetic basis for reproductive altruism (somatic cells specialized
	at vegetative functions) in the multicellular {V}olvox carteri by
	showing how an altruistic gene may have originated through cooption
	of a life-history tradeoff gene present in a unicellular ancestor.
	{S}econd, we ask why reproductive altruism and individuality arise
	only in the larger members of the volvocine group (recognizing that
	high levels of kinship are present in all volvocine algae groups).
	{O}ur answer is that the selective pressures leading to reproductive
	altruism stem from the increasing cost of reproduction with increasing
	group size. {C}oncepts from population genetics and evolutionary
	biology appear to be sufficient to explain complexity, at least as
	it relates to the problem of the major transitions between the different

  abstract = {Protein phosphorylation is the most important mechanism for controlling
	many fundamental cellular processes in all living organisms including
	plants. A specific class of serine/threonine protein kinases, the
	mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases) play a central role
	in the transduction of various extra- and intracellular signals and
	are conserved throughout eukaryotes. These generally function via
	a cascade of networks, where MAP kinase (MAPK) is phosphorylated
	and activated by MAPK kinase (MAPKK), which itself is activated by
	MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK). Signaling through MAP kinase cascade can lead
	to cellular responses including cell division, differentiation as
	well as response to various stresses. In plants, MAP kinases are
	represented by multigene families and are organized into a complex
	network for efficient transmission of specific stimuli. Putative
	plant MAP kinase cascades have been postulated based on experimental
	analysis of in vitro interactions between specific MAP kinase components.
	These cascades have been tested in planta following expression of
	epitope-tagged kinases in protoplasts. It is known that signaling
	for cell division and stress responses in plants are mediated through
	MAP kinases and even auxin, ABA and possibly ethylene and cytokinin
	also utilize a MAP kinase pathway. Most of the biotic (pathogens
	and pathogen-derived elicitors) including wounding and abiotic stresses
	(salinity, cold, drought, and oxidative) can induce defense responses
	in plants through MAP kinase pathways. In this article we have covered
	the historical background, biochemical assay, activation/inactivation,
	and targets of MAP kinases with emphasis on plant MAP kinases and
	the responses regulated by them. The cross-talk between plant MAP
	kinases is also discussed to bring out the complexity within this

  abstract = {B{ACKGROUND}: {C}ore promoters are the gene regulatory regions most
	proximal to the transcription start site ({TSS}), central to the
	formation of pre-initiation complexes and for combinatorial gene
	regulation. {T}he {DNA} elements required for core promoter function
	in plants are poorly understood. {T}o establish the sequence motifs
	that characterize plant core promoters and to compare them to the
	corresponding sequences in animals, we took advantage of available
	full-length c{DNA}s ({FL}-c{DNA}s) and predicted upstream regulatory
	sequences to carry out the analysis of 12,749 {A}rabidopsis core
	promoters. {RESULTS}: {U}sing a combination of expectation maximization
	and {G}ibbs sampling methods, we identified several motifs overrepresented
	in {A}rabidopsis core promoters. {O}ne of them corresponded to the
	{TATA} element, for which an in-depth analysis resulted in the generation
	of robust {TATA} {N}ucleotide {F}requency {M}atrices ({NFM}s) capable
	of predicting {A}rabidopsis {TATA} elements with a high degree of
	confidence. {W}e established that approximately 29\% of all {A}rabidopsis
	promoters contain {TATA} motifs, clustered around position -32 with
	respect to the {TSS}. {T}he presence of {TATA} elements was associated
	with genes represented more frequently in {EST} collections and with
	shorter 5' {UTR}s. {N}o cis-elements were found over-represented
	in {TATA}-less, compared to {TATA}-containing promoters. {CONCLUSION}:
	{O}ur studies provide a first genome-wide illustration of the composition
	and structure of core {A}rabidopsis promoters. {T}he percentage of
	{TATA}-containing promoters is much lower than commonly recognized,
	yet comparable to the number of {D}rosophila promoters containing
	a {TATA} element. {A}lthough several other {DNA} elements were identified
	as over-represented in {A}rabidopsis promoters, they are present
	in only a small fraction of the genes and they represent elements
	not previously described in animals, suggesting a distinct architecture
	of the core promoters of plant and animal genes.},

	evolution in terms of domains. {A} single paradigm for the analysis
	of interactions at different layers, such as domain and protein layers,
	is needed. {RESULTS}: {A}pplying a colored vertex graph model, we
	integrated two basic interaction layers under a unified model: (1)
	structural domains and (2) their protein/complex networks. {W}e identified
	four basic and distinct elements in the model that explains protein
	interactions at the domain level. {W}e searched for motifs in the
	networks to detect their topological characteristics using a pruning
	strategy and a hash table for rapid detection. {W}e obtained the
	following results: first, compared with a random distribution, a
	substantial part of the protein interactions could be explained by
	domain-level structural interaction information. {S}econd, there
	were distinct kinds of protein interaction patterns classified by
	specific and distinguishable numbers of domains. {T}he intermolecular
	domain interaction was the most dominant protein interaction pattern.
	{T}hird, despite the coverage of the protein interaction information
	differing among species, the similarity of their networks indicated
	shared architectures of protein interaction network in living organisms.
	{R}emarkably, there were only a few basic architectures in the model
	(>10 for a 4-node network topology), and we propose that most biological
	combinations of domains into proteins and complexes can be explained
	by a small number of key topological motifs. {CONTACT}: doheon@kaist.ac.kr.},

	as well as multiple alignments of {DNA} and protein sequences is
	proposed. {R}ather than forcing alignments to either align single
	residues or to introduce gaps by defining an alignment as a path
	running right from the source up to the sink in the associated dot-matrix
	diagram, we propose to consider alignments as consistent equivalence
	relations defined on the set of all positions occurring in all sequences
	under consideration. {W}e also propose constructing alignments from
	whole segments exhibiting highly significant overall similarity rather
	than by aligning individual residues. {C}onsequently, we present
	an alignment algorithm that (i) is based on segment-to-segment comparison
	instead of the commonly used residue-to-residue comparison and which
	(ii) avoids the well-known difficulties concerning the choice of
	appropriate gap penalties: gaps are not treated explicity, but remain
	as those parts of the sequences that do not belong to any of the
	aligned segments. {F}inally, we discuss the application of our algorithm
	to two test examples and compare it with commonly used alignment
	methods. {A}s a first example, we aligned a set of 11 {DNA} sequences

	response and those contributing to the subsequent hormone-refractory
	cell growth remain poorly understood. {H}ere, c{DNA} microarray analysis

	androgen deprivation therapy revealed distinct global gene expression
	profiles in primary, regressing and recurrent tumors. {E}lucidation
	of the genes involved in the transition between these states implicated
	specific molecular mechanisms in therapy failure and tumor progression.
	{F}irst, we identified a set of androgen-responsive genes whose expression
	decreased during the therapy response, but was then systematically
	restored in the recurrent tumors. {I}n addition, altered expression
	of genes that encode known targets of rapamycin or that converge
	on the {PI}3{K}/{AKT}/{FRAP} pathway was observed in the recurrent
	tumors. {F}urther suggestion for the involvement of these genes in
	hormone-refractory prostate cancer came from the observation that
	cells established from the recurrent xenografts were strongly inhibited
	in vitro by rapamycin. {T}he results of this functional genomic analysis
	suggest that the combined effect of re-expression of androgen-responsive

  abstract = {LIF (leukaemia inhibitory factor) is commonly used to maintain mouse
	embryonic stem cells in an undifferentiated state. These cells spontaneously
	differentiate when allowed to aggregate in the absence of LIF, forming
	embryoid bodies in which early embryonic cell lineages develop. Using
	embryoid bodies cultured in the presence and absence of LIF, we show
	that although LIF inhibited the development of visceral and parietal
	endodermal cells, it did not affect the differentiation of the primitive
	endodermal cell precursors of these extraembryonic cell lineages.
	Furthermore, deposition of the basement membrane produced by the
	primitive endodermal cells, which separates them from the remaining
	cells of the embryoid body, still occurred. The differentiation of
	primitive ectodermal cells and their progeny was inhibited by LIF,
	as evidenced by the lack of expression of FGF-5, muscle, and neuronal
	markers. However, cavitation of the embryoid body and maintenance
	of the cells in contact with the primitive endodermal basement membrane
	as an epiblast epithelium still occurred normally in the presence
	of LIF. These results indicate that cavitation and formation of the
	epiblast epithelium are regulated by mechanisms distinct from those
	controlling the differentiation of epiblast cell lineages. Furthermore,
	although epithelium formation and cavitation do not require the differentiation
	of visceral endodermal cells, the results are consistent with the
	hypothesis that the primitive endodermal basement membrane is sufficient
	to induce the epithelialization of undifferentiated embryonic stem
	cells necessary for cavitation.},

	far from coding sequences and cannot be extracted from genome on

	{T}o explore the feasibility of {CRM} extraction from a genome, we

	{B}ased on this set of experimental data, we developed a strategy
	for statistical extraction of cis-regulatory modules from the genome,
	using exhaustive analysis of local word frequency ({LWF}). {T}o assess
	the performance of our analysis, we measured the correlation between
	predictions generated by the {LWF} algorithm and the distribution
	of conserved non-coding regions in a number of {D}rosophila developmental
	genes. {CONCLUSIONS}: {I}n most of the cases tested, we observed
	high correlation (up to 0.6-0.8, measured on the entire gene locus)
	between the two independent techniques. {W}e discuss computational

  abstract = {Charles {D}arwin proposed that evolution occurs primarily by natural
	selection, but this view has been controversial from the beginning.
	{T}wo of the major opposing views have been mutationism and neutralism.
	{E}arly molecular studies suggested that most amino acid substitutions
	in proteins are neutral or nearly neutral and the functional change
	of proteins occurs by a few key amino acid substitutions. {T}his
	suggestion generated an intense controversy over selectionism and
	neutralism. {T}his controversy is partially caused by {K}imura's
	definition of neutrality, which was too strict (|2{N}s|< or =1).
	{I}f we define neutral mutations as the mutations that do not change
	the function of gene products appreciably, many controversies disappear
	because slightly deleterious and slightly advantageous mutations
	are engulfed by neutral mutations. {T}he ratio of the rate of nonsynonymous
	nucleotide substitution to that of synonymous substitution is a useful
	quantity to study positive {D}arwinian selection operating at highly
	variable genetic loci, but it does not necessarily detect adaptively
	important codons. {P}reviously, multigene families were thought to
	evolve following the model of concerted evolution, but new evidence
	indicates that most of them evolve by a birth-and-death process of
	duplicate genes. {I}t is now clear that most phenotypic characters
	or genetic systems such as the adaptive immune system in vertebrates
	are controlled by the interaction of a number of multigene families,
	which are often evolutionarily related and are subject to birth-and-death
	evolution. {T}herefore, it is important to study the mechanisms of
	gene family interaction for understanding phenotypic evolution. {B}ecause
	gene duplication occurs more or less at random, phenotypic evolution
	contains some fortuitous elements, though the environmental factors
	also play an important role. {T}he randomness of phenotypic evolution
	is qualitatively different from allele frequency changes by random
	genetic drift. {H}owever, there is some similarity between phenotypic
	and molecular evolution with respect to functional or environmental
	constraints and evolutionary rate. {I}t appears that mutation (including
	gene duplication and other {DNA} changes) is the driving force of
	evolution at both the genic and the phenotypic levels.},

  pages = {S4},
  abstract = {Over the last two decades a large number of algorithms has been developed
	for regulatory motif finding. Here we show how many of these algorithms,
	especially those that model binding specificities of regulatory factors
	with position specific weight matrices (WMs), naturally arise within
	a general Bayesian probabilistic framework. We discuss how WMs are
	constructed from sets of regulatory sites, how sites for a given
	WM can be discovered by scanning of large sequences, how to cluster
	WMs, and more generally how to cluster large sets of sites from different
	WMs into clusters. We discuss how 'regulatory modules', clusters
	of sites for subsets of WMs, can be found in large intergenic sequences,
	and we discuss different methods for ab initio motif finding, including
	expectation maximization (EM) algorithms, and motif sampling algorithms.
	Finally, we extensively discuss how module finding methods and ab
	initio motif finding methods can be extended to take phylogenetic
	relations between the input sequences into account, i.e. we show
	how motif finding and phylogenetic footprinting can be integrated
	in a rigorous probabilistic framework. The article is intended for
	readers with a solid background in applied mathematics, and preferably
	with some knowledge of general Bayesian probabilistic methods. The
	main purpose of the article is to elucidate that all these methods
	are not a disconnected set of individual algorithmic recipes, but
	that they are just different facets of a single integrated probabilistic
	theory.},

	can be derived from heterogeneous sources such as a mixture of alignment
	programs and/or structure superposition. Here, we illustrate the
	power of the approach by using a combination of local and global
	pair-wise alignments to generate the library. The resulting alignments
	are significantly more reliable, as determined by comparison with
	a set of 141 test cases, than any of the popular alternatives that

	uncharacterized genome.},
  journal = {BMC Genomics},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {9},
  pages = {312},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Benefits from high-throughput sequencing using 454 pyrosequencing
	technology may be most apparent for species with high societal or
	economic value but few genomic resources. Rapid means of gene sequence
	and SNP discovery using this novel sequencing technology provide
	a set of baseline tools for genome-level research. However, it is
	questionable how effective the sequencing of large numbers of short
	reads for species with essentially no prior gene sequence information
	will support contig assemblies and sequence annotation. RESULTS:
	With the purpose of generating the first broad survey of gene sequences
	in Eucalyptus grandis, the most widely planted hardwood tree species,
	we used 454 technology to sequence and assemble 148 Mbp of expressed
	sequences (EST). EST sequences were generated from a normalized cDNA
	pool comprised of multiple tissues and genotypes, promoting discovery
	of homologues to almost half of Arabidopsis genes, and a comprehensive
	survey of allelic variation in the transcriptome. By aligning the
	sequencing reads from multiple genotypes we detected 23,742 SNPs,
	83\% of which were validated in a sample. Genome-wide nucleotide
	diversity was estimated for 2,392 contigs using a modified theta
	(theta) parameter, adapted for measuring genetic diversity from polymorphisms
	detected by randomly sequencing a multi-genotype cDNA pool. Diversity
	estimates in non-synonymous nucleotides were on average 4x smaller
	than in synonymous, suggesting purifying selection. Non-synonymous
	to synonymous substitutions (Ka/Ks) among 2,001 contigs averaged
	0.30 and was skewed to the right, further supporting that most genes
	are under purifying selection. Comparison of these estimates among
	contigs identified major functional classes of genes under purifying
	and diversifying selection in agreement with previous researches.
	CONCLUSION: In providing an abundance of foundational transcript
	sequences where limited prior genomic information existed, this work
	created part of the foundation for the annotation of the E. grandis
	genome that is being sequenced by the US Department of Energy. In
	addition we demonstrated that SNPs sampled in large-scale with 454
	pyrosequencing can be used to detect evolutionary signatures among
	genes, providing one of the first genome-wide assessments of nucleotide
	diversity and Ka/Ks for a non-model plant species.},

  abstract = {A recent hypothesis on the origin of eukaryotic phototrophs proposes
	that red algae, green plants (land plants plus green algae), and
	glaucophytes constitute the primary photosynthetic eukaryotes, whose
	plastids may have originated directly from a cyanobacterium-like
	prokaryote via primary endosymbiosis, whereas the plastids of other
	lineages of eukaryotic phototrophs appear to be the result of secondary
	endosymbiotic events involving a phototrophic eukaryote and a host
	cell. {H}owever, the phylogenetic relationships among the three lineages
	of primary photosynthetic eukaryotes remained unresolved because
	previous nuclear multigene phylogenies used incomplete red algal
	gene sequences derived mainly from {P}orphyra ({R}hodophyceae, one
	of the two lineages of the {R}hodophyta), and lacked sequences from
	the {C}yanidiophyceae (the other red algal lineage). {R}ecently,
	the complete nuclear genome sequences from the red alga {C}yanidioschyzon
	merolae 10{D} of the {C}yanidiophyceae were determined. {U}sing this
	genomic information, nuclear multigene phylogenetic analyses of various
	lineages of mitochondrion-containing eukaryotes were conducted. {S}ince
	bacterial and amitochondrial eukaryotic genes present serious problems
	to eukaryotic phylogenies, basal eukaryotes were deduced based on
	the paralogous comparison of the concatenated alpha- and beta-tubulin.
	{T}he comparison demonstrated that cellular slime molds ({A}moebozoa)
	represent the most basal position within the mitochondrion-containing
	organisms. {W}ith the cellular slime molds as the outgroup, phylogenetic
	analyses based on a 1,525-amino acid sequence of four concatenated
	nuclear genes [actin, elongation factor-1alpha( {EF}-1alpha), alpha-tubulin,
	and beta-tubulin] resolved the presence of two large, robust monophyletic
	groups and the basal eukaryotic lineages ({A}moebozoa). {O}ne of
	the two groups corresponded to the {O}pisthokonta ({M}etazoa and
	{F}ungi), whereas the other included various lineages containing
	primary and secondary plastids (red algae, green plants, glaucophytes,
	euglenoids, heterokonts, and apicomplexans), {C}iliophora, {K}inetoplastida,
	dinoflagellates, and {H}eterolobosea, for which the red algae represented
	the most basal lineage. {T}herefore, the plastid primary endosymbiosis
	likely occurred once in the common ancestor of the latter group,
	and the primary plastids were subsequently lost in the ancestor(s)
	of organisms within the group that now lacks primary plastids. {A}
	new concept of {P}lantae was proposed for phototrophic and nonphototrophic
	organisms belonging to this group on the basis of their common history
	of plastid primary endosymbiosis. {T}his new scenario of plastid
	evolution is discussed here, and is compared with recent genome information
	and findings on the secondary endosymbiosis of the {E}uglena plastid.},

	are characterized by primitive features, such as a lack of flagella
	and the presence of phycobiliproteins in the chloroplast. {R}ecent
	molecular phylogenetic studies using nuclear gene sequences suggest
	two conflicting hypotheses (monophyly versus non-monophyly) regarding
	the relationships between red algae and green plants. {A}lthough
	kingdom-level phylogenetic analyses using multiple nuclear genes
	from a wide-range of eukaryotic lineages were very recently carried
	out, they used highly divergent gene sequences of the cryptomonad
	nucleomorph (as the red algal taxon) or incomplete red algal gene
	sequences. {I}n addition, previous eukaryotic phylogenies based on
	nuclear genes generally included very distant archaebacterial sequences
	(designated as the outgroup) and/or amitochondrial organisms, which
	may carry unusual gene substitutions due to parasitism or the absence
	of mitochondria. {H}ere, we carried out phylogenetic analyses of
	various lineages of mitochondria-containing eukaryotic organisms
	using nuclear multigene sequences, including the complete sequences
	from the primitive red alga {C}yanidioschyzon merolae. {A}mino acid
	sequence data for two concatenated paralogous genes (alpha- and beta-tubulin)
	from mitochondria-containing organisms robustly resolved the basal
	position of the cellular slime molds, which were designated as the
	outgroup in our phylogenetic analyses. {P}hylogenetic analyses of
	53 operational taxonomic units ({OTU}s) based on a 1525-amino-acid
	sequence of four concatenated nuclear genes (actin, elongation factor-1alpha,
	alpha-tubulin, and beta-tubulin) reliably resolved the phylogeny
	only in the maximum parsimonious ({MP}) analysis, which indicated
	the presence of two large robust monophyletic groups ({G}roups {A}
	and {B}) and the basal eukaryotic lineages (red algae, true slime
	molds, and amoebae). {G}roup {A} corresponded to the {O}pisthokonta
	({M}etazoa and {F}ungi), whereas {G}roup {B} included various primary
	and secondary plastid-containing lineages (green plants, glaucophytes,
	euglenoids, heterokonts, and apicomplexans), {C}iliophora, {K}inetoplastida,
	and {H}eterolobosea. {T}he red algae represented the sister lineage
	to {G}roup {B}. {U}sing 34 {OTU}s for which essentially the entire
	amino acid sequences of the four genes are known, {MP}, distance,
	quartet puzzling, and two types of maximum likelihood ({ML}) calculations
	all robustly resolved the monophyly of {G}roup {B}, as well as the
	basal position of red algae within eukaryotic organisms. {I}n addition,
	phylogenetic analyses of a concatenated 4639-amino-acid sequence
	for 12 nuclear genes (excluding the {EF}-2 gene) of 12 mitochondria-containing
	{OTU}s (including {C}. merolae) resolved a robust non-sister relationship
	between green plants and red algae within a robust monophyletic group
	composed of red algae and the eukaryotic organisms belonging to {G}roup
	{B}. {A} new scenario for the origin and evolution of plastids is
	suggested, based on the basal phylogenetic position of the red algae
	within the large clade ({G}roup {B} plus red algae). {T}he primary
	plastid endosymbiosis likely occurred once in the common ancestor
	of this large clade, and the primary plastids were subsequently lost
	in the ancestor(s) of the {D}iscicristata (euglenoids, {K}inetoplastida,
	and {H}eterolobosea), {H}eterokontophyta, and {A}lveolata (apicomplexans
	and {C}iliophora). {I}n addition, a new concept of "{P}lantae" is
	proposed for phototrophic and nonphototrophic organisms belonging
	to {G}roup {B} and red algae, on the basis of the common history
	of the primary plastid endosymbiosis. {T}he {P}lantae include primary
	plastid-containing phototrophs and nonphototrophic eukaryotes that

  abstract = {B{ACKGROUND}: {A}ll previously reported eukaryotic nuclear genome
	sequences have been incomplete, especially in highly repeated units
	and chromosomal ends. {B}ecause repetitive {DNA} is important for
	many aspects of biology, complete chromosomal structures are fundamental
	for understanding eukaryotic cells. {O}ur earlier, nearly complete
	genome sequence of the hot-spring red alga {C}yanidioschyzon merolae
	revealed several unique features, including just three ribosomal
	{DNA} copies, very few introns, and a small total number of genes.
	{H}owever, because the exact structures of certain functionally important
	repeated elements remained ambiguous, that sequence was not complete.
	{O}bviously, those ambiguities needed to be resolved before the unique
	features of the {C}. merolae genome could be summarized, and the
	ambiguities could only be resolved by completing the sequence. {T}herefore,
	we aimed to complete all previous gaps and sequence all remaining
	chromosomal ends, and now report the first nuclear-genome sequence
	for any eukaryote that is 100\% complete. {RESULTS}: {O}ur present
	complete sequence consists of 16546747 nucleotides covering 100\%
	of the 20 linear chromosomes from telomere to telomere, representing
	the simple and unique chromosomal structures of the eukaryotic cell.
	{W}e have unambiguously established that the {C}. merolae genome
	contains the smallest known histone-gene cluster, a unique telomeric
	repeat for all chromosomal ends, and an extremely low number of transposons.
	{CONCLUSION}: {B}y virtue of these attributes and others that we
	had discovered previously, {C}. merolae appears to have the simplest
	nuclear genome of the non-symbiotic eukaryotes. {T}hese unusually
	simple genomic features in the 100\% complete genome sequence of
	{C}. merolae are extremely useful for further studies of eukaryotic
	cells.},

	A complete overview of this gene family in rice is presented, including
	gene structures, phylogenies, genome localizations, and expression
	profiles. We also performed a comparative analysis of these genes
	in rice and Arabidopsis. Conserved amino acid residues and phylogeny
	construction using the NAC conserved domain sequence suggest that
	OsNAC gene family was classified broadly into two major groups (A
	and B) and sixteen subgroups in rice. We presented more specific
	phylogenetic analysis of OsNAC proteins based on the DNA-binding
	domain and known gene function, respectively. Loss of introns was
	observed in the segmental duplication. Homologous, paralogous, and
	orthologous searches of rice and Arabidopsis revealed that the major
	functional diversification within the NAC gene family predated the
	divergence of monocots and dicots. The chromosomal localizations
	of OsNAC genes indicated nine segmental duplication events involving
	18 genes; 32 non-redundant OsNAC genes were involved in tandem duplications.
	Expression levels of this gene family were checked under various
	abiotic stresses (cold, drought, submergence, laid-down submergence,
	osmotic, salinity and hormone) and biotic stresses [infection with
	rice viruses such as RSV (rice stripe virus) and RTSV (rice tungro
	spherical virus)]. Biotic stresses are novel work and increase the
	possibilities for finding the best candidate genes. A preliminary
	search based on our microarray (22K and 44K) data suggested that
	more than 45 and 26 non-redundant genes in this family were upregulated
	in response to abiotic and biotic stresses, respectively. All of
	the genes were further investigated for their stress responsiveness
	by RT-PCR analysis. Six genes showed preferential expression under
	both biotic RSV and RTSV stress. Eleven genes were upregulated by
	at least three abiotic treatments. Our study provides a very useful
	reference for cloning and functional analysis of members of this
	gene family in rice.},

	is of considerable importance, but remains difficult for protein
	families, such as transcription factors, which have loosely defined
	target sequences. {I}t is generally assumed that protein affinity
	for {DNA} involves additive contributions from successive nucleotide
	pairs within the target sequence. {T}his is not necessarily true,
	and non-additive effects have already been experimentally demonstrated
	in a small number of cases. {T}he principal origin of non-additivity
	involves the so-called indirect component of protein-{DNA} recognition
	which is related to the sequence dependence of {DNA} deformation
	induced during complex formation. {N}on-additive effects are difficult
	to study because they require the identification of many more binding
	sequences than are normally necessary for describing additive specificity
	(typically via the construction of weight matrices). {RESULTS}: {I}n
	the present work we will use theoretically estimated binding energies
	as a basis for overcoming this problem. {O}ur approach enables us
	to study the full combinatorial set of sequences for a variety of
	{DNA}-binding proteins, make a detailed analysis of non-additive
	effects and exploit this information to improve binding site predictions
	using either weight matrices or support vector machines. {T}he results
	underline the fact that, even in the presence of significant deformation,
	non-additive effects may involve only a limited number of dinucleotide
	steps. {T}his information helps to reduce the number of binding sites
	which need to be identified for successful predictions and to avoid
	problems of over-fitting. {AVAILABILITY}: {T}he {SVM} software is

	rice plants that constitutively expressed {CBF}3/{DREB}1{A} ({CBF}3)
	and {ABF}3, {A}rabidopsis genes that function in abscisic acid-independent
	and abscisic acid-dependent stress-response pathways, respectively.
	{CBF}3 in transgenic rice elevated tolerance to drought and high
	salinity, and produced relatively low levels of tolerance to low-temperature
	exposure. {T}hese data were in direct contrast to {CBF}3 in {A}rabidopsis,
	which is known to function primarily to enhance freezing tolerance.
	{ABF}3 in transgenic rice increased tolerance to drought stress alone.
	{B}y using the 60 {K} {R}ice {W}hole {G}enome {M}icroarray and {RNA}
	gel-blot analyses, we identified 12 and 7 target genes that were
	activated in transgenic rice plants by {CBF}3 and {ABF}3, respectively,
	which appear to render the corresponding plants acclimated for stress
	conditions. {T}he target genes together with 13 and 27 additional
	genes are induced further upon exposure to drought stress, consequently
	making the transgenic plants more tolerant to stress conditions.
	{I}nterestingly, our transgenic plants exhibited neither growth inhibition
	nor visible phenotypic alterations despite constitutive expression
	of the {CBF}3 or {ABF}3, unlike the results previously obtained from

	for a basic leucine zipper transcriptional factor that belongs to
	the group of maize {O}paque-2 ({O}2)-like proteins. {F}ive different
	basic leucine zipper c{DNA} clones, designated {RISBZ}1-5, have been
	isolated from a rice seed c{DNA} library. {T}he predicted gene products
	can be divided into two groups based on their amino acid sequences.
	{A}lthough all the {RISBZ} proteins are able to interact with the
	{GCN}4 motif, only {RISBZ}1 is capable of activating (more than 100-fold
	expression) the expression of a reporter gene under a minimal promoter

	experiments using the yeast {GAL}4 {DNA} binding domain revealed

	associated with relative rise in MAFbx and fall in P311 expression.},
  journal = {BMC Vet Res},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {2},
  pages = {23},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Porcine congenital splayleg (PCS) is the most important
	congenital condition of piglets, associated with lameness and immobility,
	of unknown aetiology and pathogenesis, hence the need to better understand
	the condition by defining, in the first instance, its histopathology
	and molecular pathology. RESULTS: Semitendinosus, longissimus dorsi,
	and gastrocnemius muscles were removed from 4 sets of 2-day-old splayleg
	piglets, each with a corresponding normal litter mate. Based on immunohistochemistry
	and histological image analysis, PCS piglets showed significantly
	smaller fibre size without any accompanying sign of inflammation.
	Although there was no dramatic change in fibre type composition in
	affected muscles, several structural myosin heavy chain genes were
	significantly down-regulated. MAFbx, a major atrophy marker, was
	highly up-regulated in nearly all PCS muscles, in comparison with
	controls from normal litter mates. In contrast, P311, a novel 8 kDa
	protein, was relatively down-regulated in all the PCS muscles. To
	investigate a functional role of P311 in skeletal muscle, its full-length
	cDNA was over-expressed in murine C2C12 muscle cells, which resulted
	in enhanced cell proliferation with reduced myotube formation. Hence,
	reduced P311 expression in PCS piglets might contribute to atrophy
	through reduced muscle cell proliferation. P311, predictably, was
	down-regulated by the over-expression of calcineurin, a key signalling
	factor of muscle differentiation. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that
	PCS is a condition characterised by extensive fibre atrophy and raised
	fibre density, and propose that the combined differential expression
	of MAFbx and P311 is of potential in the diagnosis of subclinical
	PCS.},

	Patients were studied over 3 to 5 injection cycles. Cycle 1 was the
	baseline control; cycle 2 was randomized between a 1-hour reading
	aloud task ("exercise") and a 24-hour period of complete voice rest.
	For cycle 3, the patient completed the task not performed in cycle
	2. Patients who were willing to continue for cycles 4 and 5 repeated
	the experiment at one half the injection dosage. Efficacy was determined
	with a battery of voice recordings and clinical outcomes instruments
	administered via telephone at 2- to 4-week intervals. The primary
	outcome measure was the result of the Voice-Related Quality of Life
	(VRQOL) instrument. RESULTS: Nine patients (8 women, 1 man) with
	a mean age of 60.8 years (range, 42 to 76 years) completed at least
	3 injection cycles. The VRQOL results were significantly higher for
	cycles that followed the exercise task. The patients reported subjectively
	that these were some of the best injection cycles they had ever experienced.
	Some achieved equivalent results with the half-dose injection plus
	exercise. The VRQOL results after voice rest cycles were not significantly
	different from the patients' baseline cycles. CONCLUSIONS: These
	results support the conclusion that a period of intense vocalization
	immediately following laryngeal botulinum toxin injections improves
	the efficacy of the injection. Possible mechanisms are proposed.},

  abstract = {Previous immunohistochemical studies have shown an abnormal distribution
	of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, including laminin, in the
	smooth muscle layer of muscularis externa in Hirschsprung's disease
	(HD) bowel. These findings supported the hypothesis that an abnormal
	ECM microenvironment may be responsible for the failure of migration
	and/or development of the neural crest cells in the gut in HD. In
	order to determine the cause of the abnormality in laminin distribution,
	solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunoblots were
	used to quantitate the ECM protein laminin and characterize its subunits,
	respectively, in extracts of the dissected smooth muscle layer of
	the muscularis externa. In the aganglionic bowel, laminin (median
	concentration, 32.4 ng/mg of tissue) was found to be present in significantly
	greater quantity than in both the normoganglionic bowel of the same
	specimen (median, 17.2 ng/mg, P less than or equal to .05) and the
	normal bowel of age-matched controls (median, 9.7 ng/mg, P less than
	or equal to .05). Laminin concentration was also found to be significantly
	higher in normoganglionic HD bowel (median, 17.2 ng/mg) than in age-matched
	control specimens (median, 10.8 ng/mg, P less than or equal to .05).
	No difference was observed in the subunit composition of laminin
	in HD and control extracts analysed by immunoblot after polyacrylamide
	gel electrophoresis. This study demonstrates a quantitative abnormality
	of laminin in the bowel in HD, supporting the hypothesis that "abnormal

	was performed in specimens from 10 HD patients (8 aganglionic, 5

	surrounding neuronal ganglia in all the controls and in 10 proximal
	normoganglionic HD specimens. More intense tenascin immunofluorescence

	{RNA}s that fold into stem-loop structures by the ribonuclease {D}icer
	and are thought to regulate gene expression by base pairing with
	{RNA}s of protein-coding genes. {I}n {A}rabidopsis thaliana, mutations

	of {CAF} and {HEN}1 in mi{RNA} metabolism, we aimed to isolate mi{RNA}s
	from {A}rabidopsis and examine their accumulation during plant development
	in wild-type plants and in hen1-1 and caf-1 mutant plants. {W}e have

	tools for the analysis and the comparison of {RNA} sequences. {M}any
	trans-acting non-coding {RNA} genes and cis-acting {RNA} regulatory
	elements present motifs, conserved both in structure and sequence,
	that can be hardly detected by primary sequence analysis alone. {W}e
	present an algorithm that takes as input a set of unaligned {RNA}
	sequences expected to share a common motif, and outputs the regions
	that are most conserved throughout the sequences, according to a
	similarity measure that takes into account both the sequence of the
	regions and the secondary structure they can form according to base-pairing
	and thermodynamic rules. {O}nly a single parameter is needed as input,
	which denotes the number of distinct hairpins the motif has to contain.
	{N}o further constraints on the size, number and position of the
	single elements comprising the motif are required. {T}he algorithm
	can be split into two parts: first, it extracts from each input sequence
	a set of candidate regions whose predicted optimal secondary structure
	contains the number of hairpins given as input. {T}hen, the regions
	selected are compared with each other to find the groups of most
	similar ones, formed by a region taken from each sequence. {T}o avoid
	exhaustive enumeration of the search space and to reduce the execution
	time, a greedy heuristic is introduced for this task. {W}e present
	different experiments, which show that the algorithm is capable of
	characterizing and discovering known regulatory motifs in m{RNA}
	like the iron responsive element ({IRE}) and selenocysteine insertion
	sequence ({SECIS}) stem-loop structures. {W}e also show how it can
	be applied to corrupted datasets in which a motif does not appear

	aware of the potentially high rate of false positives and the need
	to control it. {O}ne key statistical shift is the move away from
	the well-known {P}-value to false discovery rate ({FDR}). {L}ess
	discussion perhaps has been spent on the sensitivity or the associated
	false negative rate ({FNR}). {T}he purpose of this paper is to explain
	in simple ways why the shift from {P}-value to {FDR} for statistical
	assessment of microarray data is necessary, to elucidate the determining
	factors of {FDR} and, for a two-sample comparative study, to discuss
	its control via sample size at the design stage. {RESULTS}: {W}e
	use a mixture model, involving differentially expressed ({DE}) and
	non-{DE} genes, that captures the most common problem of finding
	{DE} genes. {F}actors determining {FDR} are (1) the proportion of
	truly differentially expressed genes, (2) the distribution of the
	true differences, (3) measurement variability and (4) sample size.
	{M}any current small microarray studies are plagued with large {FDR},
	but controlling {FDR} alone can lead to unacceptably large {FNR}.
	{I}n evaluating a design of a microarray study, sensitivity or {FNR}
	curves should be computed routinely together with {FDR} curves. {U}nder
	certain assumptions, the {FDR} and {FNR} curves coincide, thus simplifying
	the choice of sample size for controlling the {FDR} and {FNR} jointly.},

	{I}n such regions, apparent evolutionary context dependencies exist,

	fundamental dependencies is sufficient to cause "contagious" context
	dependencies which cascade across many nucleotide sites. {S}uch large-scale
	dependencies challenge the use of traditional phylogenetic models
	in evolutionary inference because they explicitly assume evolutionary
	independence between short nucleotide tuples. {I}n our model we address
	this by replacing context dependencies within codons by annotation-specific
	heterogeneity in the substitution process. {T}hrough a general procedure,
	we fragment the alignment into sets of short nucleotide tuples based
	on both the protein coding and the structural annotation. {T}hese
	individual tuples are assumed to evolve independently, and the different
	tuple sets are assigned different annotation-specific substitution
	models shared between their members. {T}his allows us to build a

  volume = {5},
  pages = {50},
  abstract = {B{ACKGROUND}: {P}robabilistic methods have progressively supplanted
	the {M}aximum {P}arsimony ({MP}) method for inferring phylogenetic
	trees. {O}ne of the major reasons for this shift was that {MP} is
	much more sensitive to the {L}ong {B}ranch {A}ttraction ({LBA}) artefact
	than is {M}aximum {L}ikelihood ({ML}). {H}owever, recent work by
	{K}olaczkowski and {T}hornton suggested, on the basis of simulations,
	that {MP} is less sensitive than {ML} to tree reconstruction artefacts
	generated by heterotachy, a phenomenon that corresponds to shifts
	in site-specific evolutionary rates over time. {T}hese results led
	these authors to recommend that the results of {ML} and {MP} analyses
	should be both reported and interpreted with the same caution. {T}his
	specific conclusion revived the debate on the choice of the most
	accurate phylogenetic method for analysing real data in which various
	types of heterogeneities occur. {H}owever, variation of evolutionary
	rates across species was not explicitly incorporated in the original
	study of {K}olaczkowski and {T}hornton, and in most of the subsequent
	heterotachous simulations published to date, where all terminal branch
	lengths were kept equal, an assumption that is biologically unrealistic.
	{RESULTS}: {I}n this report, we performed more realistic simulations
	to evaluate the relative performance of {MP} and {ML} methods when
	two kinds of heterogeneities are considered: (i) within-site rate
	variation (heterotachy), and (ii) rate variation across lineages.
	{U}sing a similar protocol as {K}olaczkowski and {T}hornton to generate
	heterotachous datasets, we found that heterotachy, which constitutes
	a serious violation of existing models, decreases the accuracy of
	{ML} whatever the level of rate variation across lineages. {I}n contrast,
	the accuracy of {MP} can either increase or decrease when the level
	of heterotachy increases, depending on the relative branch lengths.
	{T}his result demonstrates that {MP} is not insensitive to heterotachy,
	contrary to the report of {K}olaczkowski and {T}hornton. {F}inally,
	in the case of {LBA} (i.e. when two non-sister lineages evolved faster
	than the others), {ML} outperforms {MP} over a wide range of conditions,
	except for unrealistic levels of heterotachy. {CONCLUSION}: {F}or
	realistic combinations of both heterotachy and variation of evolutionary
	rates across lineages, {ML} is always more accurate than {MP}. {T}herefore,
	{ML} should be preferred over {MP} for analysing real data, all the
	more so since parametric methods also allow one to handle other types
	of biological heterogeneities much better, such as among sites rate
	variation. {T}he confounding effects of heterotachy on tree reconstruction
	methods do exist, but can be eschewed by the development of mixture
	models in a probabilistic framework, as proposed by {K}olaczkowski
	and {T}hornton themselves.},

	of fast likelihood-based "counting methods" that employ either a
	single most likely ancestral reconstruction, weighting across all
	possible ancestral reconstructions, or sampling from ancestral reconstructions;
	(2) a random effects likelihood ({REL}) approach, which models variation
	in nonsynonymous and synonymous rates across sites according to a
	predefined distribution, with the selection pressure at an individual
	site inferred using an empirical {B}ayes approach; and (3) a fixed
	effects likelihood ({FEL}) method that directly estimates nonsynonymous
	and synonymous substitution rates at each site. {A}ll three methods
	incorporate flexible models of nucleotide substitution bias and variation
	in both nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates across sites,
	facilitating the comparison between the methods. {W}e demonstrate
	that the results obtained using these approaches show broad agreement

	substitution rates. {C}ounting methods are well suited for large
	alignments, for which there is high power to detect positive and

	rate. {A} {REL} approach, which is more computationally intensive
	than counting methods, has higher power than counting methods to
	detect selection in data sets of intermediate size but may suffer
	from higher rates of false positives for small data sets. {A} {FEL}
	approach appears to capture the pattern of rate variation better
	than counting methods or random effects models, does not suffer from
	as many false positives as random effects models for data sets comprising
	few sequences, and can be efficiently parallelized. {O}ur results
	suggest that previously reported differences between results obtained
	by counting methods and random effects models arise due to a combination
	of the conservative nature of counting-based methods, the failure
	of current random effects models to allow for variation in synonymous

	at a preselected level is often impractical. {C}onsequently, it has
	been suggested to use the q-value as an estimate of the proportion
	of false discoveries among a set of significant findings. {H}owever,
	such an interpretation of the q-value may be unwarranted considering
	that the q-value is based on an unstable estimator of the positive
	{FDR} (p{FDR}). {A}nother method proposes estimating the {FDR} by
	modeling p-values as arising from a beta-uniform mixture ({BUM})
	distribution. {U}nfortunately, the {BUM} approach is reliable only
	in settings where the assumed model accurately represents the actual

	{LOESS} histogram ({SPLOSH}) is proposed for estimating the conditional
	{FDR} (c{FDR}), the expected proportion of false positives conditioned
	on having k 'significant' findings. {SPLOSH} is designed to be more
	stable than the q-value and applicable in a wider variety of settings

  abstract = {B{ACKGROUND}: {T}he wealth of genomic data in bacteria is helping
	microbiologists understand the factors involved in gene innovation.
	{A}mong these, the expansion and reduction of gene families appears
	to have a fundamental role in this, but the factors influencing gene
	family size are unclear. {RESULTS}: {T}he relative content of paralogous
	genes in bacterial genomes increases with genome size, largely due
	to the expansion of gene family size in large genomes. {B}acteria
	undergoing genome reduction display a parallel process of redundancy
	elimination, by which gene families are reduced to one or a few members.
	{G}ene family size is also influenced by sequence divergence and
	physiological function. {L}arge gene families show wider sequence
	divergence, suggesting they are probably older, and certain functions
	(such as metabolite transport mechanisms) are overrepresented in
	large families. {T}he size of a given gene family is remarkably similar
	in strains of the same species and in closely related species, suggesting
	that homologous gene families are vertically transmitted and depend
	little on horizontal gene transfer ({HGT}). {CONCLUSIONS}: {T}he
	remarkable preservation of copy numbers in widely different ecotypes
	indicates a functional role for the different copies rather than
	simply a back-up role. {W}hen different genera are compared, the
	increase in phylogenetic distance and/or ecological specialization
	disrupts this preservation, albeit in a gradual manner and maintaining

  abstract = {R{NA} interference ({RNA}i) is an intracellular mechanism for post-transcriptional
	gene silencing that is frequently used to study gene function. {RNA}i
	is initiated by short interfering {RNA} (si{RNA}) of approximately
	21 nt in length, either generated from the double-stranded {RNA}
	(ds{RNA}) by using the enzyme {D}icer or introduced experimentally.
	{F}ollowing association with an {RNA}i silencing complex, si{RNA}
	targets m{RNA} transcripts that have sequence identity for destruction.
	{A} phenotype resulting from this knockdown of expression may inform
	about the function of the targeted gene. {H}owever, 'off-target effects'
	compromise the specificity of {RNA}i if sequence identity between
	si{RNA} and random m{RNA} transcripts causes {RNA}i to knockdown
	expression of non-targeted genes. {T}he complete off-target effects
	must be investigated systematically on each gene in a genome by adjusting
	a group of parameters, which is too expensive to conduct experimentally
	and motivates a study in silico. {T}his computational study examined
	the potential for off-target effects of {RNA}i, employing the genome
	and transcriptome sequence data of {H}omo sapiens, {C}aenorhabditis
	elegans and {S}chizosaccharomyces pombe. {T}he chance for {RNA}i
	off-target effects proved considerable, ranging from 5 to 80\% for
	each of the organisms, when using as parameter the exact identity
	between any possible si{RNA} sequences (arbitrary length ranging
	from 17 to 28 nt) derived from a ds{RNA} (range 100-400 nt) representing
	the coding sequences of target genes and all other si{RNA}s within
	the genome. {R}emarkably, high-sequence specificity and low probability
	for off-target reactivity were optimally balanced for si{RNA} of
	21 nt, the length observed mostly in vivo. {T}he chance for off-target
	{RNA}i increased (although not always significantly) with greater
	length of the initial ds{RNA} sequence, inclusion into the analysis
	of available untranslated region sequences and allowing for mismatches
	between si{RNA} and target sequences. si{RNA} sequences from within
	100 nt of the 5' termini of coding sequences had low chances for
	off-target reactivity. {T}his may be owing to coding constraints
	for signal peptide-encoding regions of genes relative to regions
	that encode for mature proteins. {O}ff-target distribution varied
	along the chromosomes of {C}.elegans, apparently owing to the use
	of more unique sequences in gene-dense regions. {F}inally, biological
	and thermodynamical descriptors of effective si{RNA} reduced the
	number of potential si{RNA}s compared with those identified by sequence
	identity alone, but off-target {RNA}i remained likely, with an off-target
	error rate of approximately 10\%. {T}hese results also suggest a
	direction for future in vivo studies that could both help in calibrating
	true off-target rates in living organisms and also in contributing
	evidence toward the debate of whether si{RNA} efficacy is correlated
	with, or independent of, the target molecule. {I}n summary, off-target
	effects present a real but not prohibitive concern that should be
	considered for {RNA}i experiments.},

	?translation?, ?transduction?, ?genetic information?, ?chemical signals?,
	?cell signaling? etc. {A}s the concept of information and its plethora
	of associated notions were introduced in biology, several problems
	emerged, with which the tradition of biology was unprepared to cope.
	{I}nstead of deepening the discussion about ?information talk?, the
	trend in the biological sciences was one of treating ?information?
	as merely sequence information in {DNA} or proteins. {T}oday, a number
	of researchers consider information talk as inadequate and ?just
	metaphorical?, expressing a skepticism about the use of the term
	?information? and its derivatives in biology as a natural science.
	{W}e disagree with this position, claiming instead that the notion
	of information and other related ideas grasp some fundamental features
	of biological systems and processes that might be otherwise neglected.
	{O}ur problem is not to get rid of information talk, but rather to
	clarify it by using a proper theoretical framework. {W}e intend to
	show that the use of semiotic concepts and theories to interpret
	information talk can contribute to the construction of a precise
	and coherent account of information in biology. {F}or this purpose,
	we introduce here a model of information as semiosis, grounded on
	{P}eircean semiotics. {P}eirce?s formal science of signs provides
	an analytic framework in which information can be modeled as a pragmatic
	triadic dependent process that irreducibly connects signs, objects,
	and interpretants (effects on interpreters). {A}ccording to the model
	developed in this paper, information is treated as semiosis, i.e.,
	the communication of a form or habit from an object to an interpretant
	through a sign, so as to constrain (in general) the interpretant
	as a sign or (in biological systems) the interpreter?s behavior.
	{W}e employ this treatment of information for building an account
	of genes as signs and genetic information as semiosis.},

	programs that identify protein coding sequence are used with remarkable
	success in the annotation of genomes, the development of computational
	methods to analyze noncoding regions and to delineate transcriptional

	novel algorithms to detect cis-regulatory modules through genome
	wide scans for clusters of transcription factor binding sites using
	three levels of prior information. {W}hen binding sites for the factors
	are known, our statistical segmentation algorithm, {A}hab, yields
	about 150 putative gap gene regulated modules, with no adjustable

	are known, but no binding sites, repeated motifs can be found by
	a customized {G}ibbs sampler and input to {A}hab, to predict genes
	with similar regulation. {F}inally using only the genome, we developed
	a third algorithm, {A}rgos, that counts and scores clusters of overrepresented
	motifs in a window of sequence. {A}rgos recovers many of the known
	modules, upstream of the segmentation genes, with no training data.
	{CONCLUSIONS}: {W}e have demonstrated, in the case of body patterning

	identification of regulatory modules. {W}e believe that {A}hab overcomes

  abstract = {Activity of axillary meristems dictates the architecture of both vegetative
	and reproductive parts of a plant. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a model
	eudicot species, the transcription factor LFY confers a floral fate
	to new meristems arising from the periphery of the reproductive shoot
	apex. Diverse orthologous LFY genes regulate vegetative-to-reproductive
	phase transition when expressed in Arabidopsis, a property not shared
	by RFL, the homolog in the agronomically important grass, rice. We
	have characterized RFL by knockdown of its expression and by its
	ectopic overexpression in transgenic rice. We find that reduction
	in RFL expression causes a dramatic delay in transition to flowering,
	with the extreme phenotype being no flowering. Conversely, RFL overexpression
	triggers precocious flowering. In these transgenics, the expression
	levels of known flowering time genes reveal RFL as a regulator of
	OsSOC1 (OsMADS50), an activator of flowering. Aside from facilitating
	a transition of the main growth axis to an inflorescence meristem,
	RFL expression status affects vegetative axillary meristems and therefore
	regulates tillering. The unique spatially and temporally regulated
	RFL expression during the development of vegetative axillary bud
	(tiller) primordia and inflorescence branch primordia is therefore
	required to produce tillers and panicle branches, respectively. Our
	data provide mechanistic insights into a unique role for RFL in determining
	the typical rice plant architecture by regulating distinct downstream
	pathways. These results offer a means to alter rice flowering time
	and plant architecture by manipulating RFL-mediated pathways.},

	structures with stochastic context free grammars. {S}everal types
	of analysis are invalidated by the presence of ambiguity. {A}s this
	problem inherits undecidability (as we show here) from the namely
	problem for context free languages, there is no complete algorithmic
	solution to the problem of ambiguity checking. {RESULTS}: {W}e explain
	frequently observed sources of ambiguity, and show how to avoid them.
	{W}e suggest four testing procedures that may help to detect ambiguity
	when present, including a just-in-time test that permits to work
	safely with a potentially ambiguous grammar. {W}e introduce, for
	the special case of stochastic context free grammars and {RNA} structure
	modeling, an automated partial procedure for proving non-ambiguity.
	{I}t is used to demonstrate non-ambiguity for several relevant grammars.

	of monitoring expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously
	and identifying those genes that are differentially expressed. {T}he
	probability that a false identification (type {I} error) is committed
	can increase sharply when the number of tested genes gets large.
	{C}orrelation between the test statistics attributed to gene co-regulation
	and dependency in the measurement errors of the gene expression levels
	further complicates the problem. {I}n this paper we address this
	very large multiplicity problem by adopting the false discovery rate
	({FDR}) controlling approach. {I}n order to address the dependency
	problem, we present three resampling-based {FDR} controlling procedures,
	that account for the test statistics distribution, and compare their
	performance to that of the na√Øve application of the linear step-up
	procedure in {B}enjamini and {H}ochberg (1995). {T}he procedures
	are studied using simulated microarray data, and their performance
	is examined relative to their ease of implementation. {RESULTS}:
	{C}omparative simulation analysis shows that all four {FDR} controlling
	procedures control the {FDR} at the desired level, and retain substantially
	more power then the family-wise error rate controlling procedures.
	{I}n terms of power, using resampling of the marginal distribution
	of each test statistics substantially improves the performance over
	the na√Øve one. {T}he highest power is achieved, at the expense of
	a more sophisticated algorithm, by the resampling-based procedures
	that resample the joint distribution of the test statistics and estimate
	the level of {FDR} control. {AVAILABILITY}: {A}n {R} program that

  abstract = {Orthologs are genes in different species that originate from a single
	gene in the last common ancestor of these species. {S}uch genes have
	often retained identical biological roles in the present-day organisms.
	{I}t is hence important to identify orthologs for transferring functional
	information between genes in different organisms with a high degree
	of reliability. {F}or example, orthologs of human proteins are often
	functionally characterized in model organisms. {U}nfortunately, orthology
	analysis between human and e.g. invertebrates is often complex because
	of large numbers of paralogs within protein families. {P}aralogs
	that predate the species split, which we call out-paralogs, can easily
	be confused with true orthologs. {P}aralogs that arose after the
	species split, which we call in-paralogs, however, are bona fide
	orthologs by definition.{O}rthologs and in-paralogs are typically
	detected with phylogenetic methods, but these are slow and difficult
	to automate. {A}utomatic clustering methods based on two-way best
	genome-wide matches on the other hand, have so far not separated
	in-paralogs from out-paralogs effectively.{W}e present a fully automatic
	method for finding orthologs and in-paralogs from two species. {O}rtholog
	clusters are seeded with a two-way best pairwise match, after which
	an algorithm for adding in-paralogs is applied. {T}he method bypasses
	multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees, which can be slow and
	error-prone steps in classical ortholog detection. {S}till, it robustly
	detects complex orthologous relationships and assigns confidence
	values for both orthologs and in-paralogs. {T}he program, called
	{INPARANOID}, was tested on all completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes.
	{T}o assess the quality of {INPARANOID} results, ortholog clusters
	were generated from a dataset of worm and mammalian transmembrane
	proteins, and were compared to clusters derived by manual tree-based
	ortholog detection methods. {T}his study led to the identification
	with a high degree of confidence of over a dozen novel worm-mammalian
	ortholog assignments that were previously undetected because of shortcomings
	of phylogenetic methods.{A} {WWW} server that allows searching for
	orthologs between human and several fully sequenced genomes is installed
	at http://www.cgb.ki.se/inparanoid/. {T}his is the first comprehensive
	resource with orthologs of all fully sequenced eukaryotic genomes.
	{P}rograms and tables of orthology assignments are available from

	Three genes derived from two down-regulated clusters were evaluated

	analysis. For these analyses, both incompatible and compatible interactions
	were included to determine if suppression of these genes was specific
	to compatibility. One gene, plastidic carbonic anhydrase (CA), was
	found to have a very different expression pattern in compatible vs.
	incompatible interactions. Virus-induced gene silencing was used
	to suppress expression of this gene in Nicotiana benthamiana. In
	CA-silenced plants, the pathogen grew more quickly, indicating that

  abstract = {The GABI Primary Database, GabiPD (http://www.gabipd.org/), was established
	in the frame of the German initiative for Genome Analysis of the
	Plant Biological System (GABI). The goal of GabiPD is to collect,
	integrate, analyze and visualize primary information from GABI projects.
	GabiPD constitutes a repository and analysis platform for a wide
	array of heterogeneous data from high-throughput experiments in several
	plant species. Data from different 'omics' fronts are incorporated
	(i.e. genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics), originating
	from 14 different model or crop species. We have developed the concept
	of GreenCards for text-based retrieval of all data types in GabiPD
	(e.g. clones, genes, mutant lines). All data types point to a central
	Gene GreenCard, where gene information is integrated from genome
	projects or NCBI UniGene sets. The centralized Gene GreenCard allows
	visualizing ESTs aligned to annotated transcripts as well as displaying
	identified protein domains and gene structure. Moreover, GabiPD makes
	available interactive genetic maps from potato and barley, and protein
	2DE gels from Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica napus. Gene expression
	and metabolic-profiling data can be visualized through MapManWeb.
	By the integration of complex data in a framework of existing knowledge,
	GabiPD provides new insights and allows for new interpretations of
	the data.},

  abstract = {A{BSTRACT}: {BACKGROUND}: {T}ranscription factors ({TF}s) are key
	regulatory proteins that enhance or repress the transcriptional rate
	of their target genes by binding to specific promoter regions (i.e.
	cis-acting elements) upon activation or de-activation of upstream
	signaling cascades. {TF}s thus constitute master control elements
	of dynamic transcriptional networks. {TF}s have fundamental roles
	in almost all biological processes (development, growth and response
	to environmental factors) and it is assumed that they play immensely
	important functions in the evolution of species. {I}n plants, {TF}s
	have been employed to manipulate various types of metabolic, developmental
	and stress response pathways. {C}ross-species comparison and identification
	of regulatory modules and hence {TF}s is thought to become increasingly
	important for the rational design of new plant biomass. {U}p to now,
	however, no computational repository is available that provides access
	to the largely complete sets of transcription factors of sequenced

  year = {2010},
  volume = {11},
  pages = {411},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein phosphorylation is an important post-translational
	modification influencing many aspects of dynamic cellular behavior.
	Site-specific phosphorylation of amino acid residues serine, threonine,
	and tyrosine can have profound effects on protein structure, activity,
	stability, and interaction with other biomolecules. Phosphorylation
	sites can be affected in diverse ways in members of any species,
	one such way is through single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The
	availability of large numbers of experimentally identified phosphorylation
	sites, and of natural variation datasets in Arabidopsis thaliana
	prompted us to analyze the effect of non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs)
	onto phosphorylation sites. RESULTS: From the analyses of 7,178 experimentally
	identified phosphorylation sites we found that: (i) Proteins with
	multiple phosphorylation sites occur more often than expected by
	chance. (ii) Phosphorylation hotspots show a preference to be located
	outside conserved domains. (iii) nsSNPs affected experimental phosphorylation
	sites as much as the corresponding non-phosphorylated amino acid
	residues. (iv) Losses of experimental phosphorylation sites by nsSNPs
	were identified in 86 A. thaliana proteins, among them receptor proteins
	were overrepresented.These results were confirmed by similar analyses
	of predicted phosphorylation sites in A. thaliana. In addition, predicted
	threonine phosphorylation sites showed a significant enrichment of
	nsSNPs towards asparagines and a significant depletion of the synonymous
	substitution. Proteins in which predicted phosphorylation sites were
	affected by nsSNPs (loss and gain), were determined to be mainly
	receptor proteins, stress response proteins and proteins involved
	in nucleotide and protein binding. Proteins involved in metabolism,
	catalytic activity and biosynthesis were less affected. CONCLUSIONS:
	We analyzed more than 7,100 experimentally identified phosphorylation
	sites in almost 4,300 protein-coding loci in silico, thus constituting
	the largest phosphoproteomics dataset for A. thaliana available to
	date. Our findings suggest a relatively high variability in the presence
	or absence of phosphorylation sites between different natural accessions
	in receptor and other proteins involved in signal transduction. Elucidating
	the effect of phosphorylation sites affected by nsSNPs on adaptive
	responses represents an exciting research goal for the future.},

	as arbitrary constructs of the human mind, as opposed to discrete,
	objective entities that represent reproductively independent lineages
	or 'units of evolution'. {H}owever, the discreteness of plant species
	and their correspondence with reproductive communities have not been
	tested quantitatively, allowing zoologists to argue that botanists
	have been overly influenced by a few 'botanical horror stories',
	such as dandelions, blackberries and oaks. {H}ere we analyse phenetic
	and/or crossing relationships in over 400 genera of plants and animals.
	{W}e show that although discrete phenotypic clusters exist in most
	genera (> 80\%), the correspondence of taxonomic species to these
	clusters is poor (< 60\%) and no different between plants and animals.
	{L}ack of congruence is caused by polyploidy, asexual reproduction
	and over-differentiation by taxonomists, but not by contemporary
	hybridization. {N}onetheless, crossability data indicate that 70\%
	of taxonomic species and 75\% of phenotypic clusters in plants correspond
	to reproductively independent lineages (as measured by postmating
	isolation), and thus represent biologically real entities. {C}ontrary
	to conventional wisdom, plant species are more likely than animal
	species to represent reproductively independent lineages.},

	their function without ever producing proteins. {N}oncoding {RNA}
	gene sequences do not have strong statistical signals, unlike protein
	coding genes. {A} reliable general purpose computational genefinder
	for noncoding {RNA} genes has been elusive. {RESULTS}: {W}e describe
	a comparative sequence analysis algorithm for detecting novel structural
	{RNA} genes. {T}he key idea is to test the pattern of substitutions
	observed in a pairwise alignment of two homologous sequences. {A}
	conserved coding region tends to show a pattern of synonymous substitutions,
	whereas a conserved structural {RNA} tends to show a pattern of compensatory
	mutations consistent with some base-paired secondary structure. {W}e
	formalize this intuition using three probabilistic "pair-grammars":
	a pair stochastic context free grammar modeling alignments constrained
	by structural {RNA} evolution, a pair hidden {M}arkov model modeling
	alignments constrained by coding sequence evolution, and a pair hidden
	{M}arkov model modeling a null hypothesis of position-independent
	evolution. {G}iven an input pairwise sequence alignment (e.g. from
	a {BLASTN} comparison of two related genomes) we classify the alignment
	into the coding, {RNA}, or null class according to the posterior
	probability of each class. {CONCLUSIONS}: {W}e have implemented this

	a scanning algorithm for detecting noncoding {RNA} genes in genome

	folding algorithm. {RESULTS}: {P}reliminary results were encouraging,
	but certain anomalies led us to do a carefully controlled investigation
	of this class of methods. {U}ltimately, our results argue that for
	the probabilistic model there is indeed a statistical effect, but
	it comes mostly from local base-composition bias and not from {RNA}
	secondary structure. {F}or the thermodynamic implementation (which
	evaluates statistical significance by doing {M}onte {C}arlo shuffling
	in fixed-length sequence windows, thus eliminating the base-composition
	effect) the signals for noncoding {RNA}s are still usually indistinguishable
	from noise, especially when certain statistical artifacts resulting
	from local base-composition inhomogeneity are taken into account.
	{W}e conclude that although a distinct, stable secondary structure
	is undoubtedly important in most noncoding {RNA}s, the stability
	of most noncoding {RNA} secondary structures is not sufficiently
	different from the predicted stability of a random sequence to be
	useful as a general genefinding approach.},

  abstract = {A{BSTRACT}: {BACKGROUND}: {M}etagenomics, sequence analyses of genomic
	{DNA} isolated directly from the environments, can be used to identify
	organisms and model community dynamics of a particular ecosystem.
	{M}etagenomics also has the potential to identify significantly different
	metabolic potential in different environments. {RESULTS}: {H}ere
	we use a statistical method to compare curated subsystems, to predict
	the physiology, metabolism, and ecology from metagenomes. {T}his
	approach can be used to identify those subsystems that are significantly
	different between metagenome sequences. {S}ubsystems that are overrepresented
	in the {S}argasso {S}ea and {A}cid {M}ine {D}rainage metagenome when
	compared to non-redundant databases were identified. {CONCLUSIONS}:
	{T}he methodology described herein applies statistics to the comparisons
	of metabolic potential in metagenomes. {T}his analysis reveals those
	subsystems that are more, or less, represented in the different environments
	that are compared. {T}hese differences in metabolic potential lead
	to several testable hypotheses about physiology and metabolism of
	microbes from these ecosystems.},

	of the major challenges in bioinformatics and integrates comparative,
	structural, and functional genomics. {M}any different approaches
	have been developed to detect conserved motifs in a set of genes
	that are either coregulated or orthologous. {H}owever, although recent
	approaches seem promising, in general, unambiguous identification
	of regulatory elements is not straightforward. {T}he delineation
	of promoters is even harder, due to its complex nature, and in silico
	promoter prediction is still in its infancy. {H}ere, we review the
	different approaches that have been developed for identifying promoters
	and their regulatory elements. {W}e discuss the detection of cis-acting
	regulatory elements using word-counting or probabilistic methods
	(so-called "search by signal" methods) and the delineation of promoters
	by considering both sequence content and structural features ("search
	by content" methods). {A}s an example of search by content, we explored
	in greater detail the association of promoters with {C}p{G} islands.
	{H}owever, due to differences in sequence content, the parameters
	used to detect {C}p{G} islands in humans and other vertebrates cannot
	be used for plants. {T}herefore, a preliminary attempt was made to
	define parameters that could possibly define {C}p{G} and {C}p{N}p{G}
	islands in {A}rabidopsis, by exploring the compositional landscape
	around the transcriptional start site. {T}o this end, a data set
	of more than 5,000 gene sequences was built, including the promoter
	region, the 5'-untranslated region, and the first introns and coding
	exons. {P}reliminary analysis shows that promoter location based
	on the detection of potential {C}p{G}/{C}p{N}p{G} islands in the
	{A}rabidopsis genome is not straightforward. {N}evertheless, because
	the landscape of {C}p{G}/{C}p{N}p{G} islands differs considerably
	between promoters and introns on the one side and exons (whether
	coding or not) on the other, more sophisticated approaches can probably
	be developed for the successful detection of "putative" {C}p{G} and

	been argued, however, that the degree of clustering is diminished

	377 to 993 markers, we systematically examine the influence of several

	assumptions about correlations in allele frequencies across populations,
	and the geographic dispersion of the sample-on the "clusteredness"
	of individuals. {W}ith all other variables held constant, geographic
	dispersion is seen to have comparatively little effect on the degree
	of clustering. {E}xamination of the relationship between genetic
	and geographic distance supports a view in which the clusters arise
	not as an artifact of the sampling scheme, but from small discontinuous
	jumps in genetic distance for most population pairs on opposite sides
	of geographic barriers, in comparison with genetic distance for pairs
	on the same side. {T}hus, analysis of the 993-locus dataset corroborates
	our earlier results: if enough markers are used with a sufficiently
	large worldwide sample, individuals can be partitioned into genetic
	clusters that match major geographic subdivisions of the globe, with
	some individuals from intermediate geographic locations having mixed
	membership in the clusters that correspond to neighboring regions.},

  abstract = {M{OTIVATION}: {P}seudoknots have generally been excluded from the
	prediction of {RNA} secondary structures due to its difficulty in
	modeling. {A}lthough, several dynamic programming algorithms exist
	for the prediction of pseudoknots using thermodynamic approaches,
	they are neither reliable nor efficient. {O}n the other hand, comparative
	methods are more reliable, but are often done in an ad hoc manner
	and require expert intervention. {M}aximum weighted matching, an
	algorithm for pseudoknot prediction with comparative analysis, suffers
	from low-prediction accuracy in many cases. {RESULTS}: {H}ere we
	present an algorithm, iterated loop matching, for reliably and efficiently
	predicting {RNA} secondary structures including pseudoknots. {T}he
	method can utilize either thermodynamic or comparative information
	or both, thus is able to predict pseudoknots for both aligned and
	individual sequences. {W}e have tested the algorithm on a number
	of {RNA} families. {U}sing 8-12 homologous sequences, the algorithm
	correctly identifies more than 90\% of base-pairs for short sequences
	and 80\% overall. {I}t correctly predicts nearly all pseudoknots
	and produces very few spurious base-pairs for sequences without pseudoknots.
	{C}omparisons show that our algorithm is both more sensitive and
	more specific than the maximum weighted matching method. {I}n addition,
	our algorithm has high-prediction accuracy on individual sequences,
	comparable with the {PKNOTS} algorithm, while using much less computational
	resources. {AVAILABILITY}: {T}he program has been implemented in
	{ANSI} {C} and is freely available for academic use at http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~zhang/projects/rna/ilm/

	that, given an observed number of tags in one library, needs to be
	found in the other library to result in a significant {P} value.
	{T}he five tests included in this comparison are {SAGE}300, the tests

	is a major control point in many biological processes. {T}ranscription
	factors ({TF}s) can activate and/or repress the transcriptional rate
	of target genes and vascular plant genomes devote approximately 7\%
	of their coding capacity to {TF}s. {G}lobal analysis of {TF}s has
	only been performed for three complete higher plant genomes - {A}rabidopsis
	({A}rabidopsis thaliana), poplar ({P}opulus trichocarpa) and rice
	({O}ryza sativa). {P}resently, no large-scale analysis of {TF}s has
	been made from a member of the {S}olanaceae, one of the most important
	families of vascular plants. {T}o fill this void, we have analysed
	tobacco ({N}icotiana tabacum) {TF}s using a dataset of 1,159,022
	gene-space sequence reads ({GSR}s) obtained by methylation filtering
	of the tobacco genome. {A}n analytical pipeline was developed to
	isolate {TF} sequences from the {GSR} data set. {T}his involved multiple
	(typically 10-15) independent searches with different versions of
	the {TF} family-defining domain(s) (normally the {DNA}-binding domain)
	followed by assembly into contigs and verification. {O}ur analysis
	revealed that tobacco contains a minimum of 2,513 {TF}s representing
	all of the 64 well-characterised plant {TF} families. {T}he number
	of {TF}s in tobacco is higher than previously reported for {A}rabidopsis
	and rice. {RESULTS}: {TOBFAC}: the database of tobacco transcription
	factors, is an integrative database that provides a portal to sequence
	and phylogeny data for the identified {TF}s, together with a large
	quantity of other data concerning {TF}s in tobacco. {T}he database
	contains an individual page dedicated to each of the 64 {TF} families.
	{T}hese contain background information, domain architecture via {P}fam
	links, a list of all sequences and an assessment of the minimum number
	of {TF}s in this family in tobacco. {D}ownloadable phylogenetic trees
	of the major families are provided along with detailed information
	on the bioinformatic pipeline that was used to find all family members.
	{TOBFAC} also contains {EST} data, a list of published tobacco {TF}s
	and a list of papers concerning tobacco {TF}s. {T}he sequences and
	annotation data are stored in relational tables using a {P}ostgrel{SQL}
	relational database management system. {T}he data processing and
	analysis pipelines used the {P}erl programming language. {T}he web
	interface was implemented in {J}ava{S}cript and {P}erl {CGI} running
	on an {A}pache web server. {T}he computationally intensive data processing
	and analysis pipelines were run on an {A}pple {XS}erve cluster with
	more than 20 nodes. {CONCLUSION}: {TOBFAC} is an expandable knowledgebase
	of tobacco {TF}s with data currently available for over 2,513 {TF}s
	from 64 gene families. {TOBFAC} integrates available sequence information,
	phylogenetic analysis, and {EST} data with published reports on tobacco
	{TF} function. {T}he database provides a major resource for the study
	of gene expression in tobacco and the {S}olanaceae and helps to fill
	a current gap in studies of {TF} families across the plant kingdom.

  abstract = {Developmental biology and evolutionary studies have merged into evolutionary
	developmental biology ("evo-devo"). This synthesis already influenced
	and still continues to change the conceptual framework of structural
	biology. One of the cornerstones of structural biology is the concept
	of homology. But the search for homology ("sameness") of biological
	structures depends on our favourite perspectives (axioms, paradigms).
	Five levels of homology ("sameness") can be identified in the literature,
	although they overlap to some degree: (i) serial homology (homonomy)
	within modular organisms, (ii) historical homology (synapomorphy),
	which is taken as the only acceptable homology by many biologists,
	(iii) underlying homology (i.e., parallelism) in closely related
	taxa, (iv) deep evolutionary homology due to the "same" master genes
	in distantly related phyla, and (v) molecular homology exclusively
	at gene level. The following essay gives emphasis on the heuristic
	advantages of seemingly opposing perspectives in structural biology,
	with examples mainly from comparative plant morphology. The organization
	of the plant body in the majority of angiosperms led to the recognition
	of the classical root-shoot model. In some lineages bauplan rules
	were transcended during evolution and development. This resulted
	in morphological misfits such as the Podostemaceae, peculiar eudicots
	adapted to submerged river rocks. Their transformed "roots" and "shoots"
	fit only to a limited degree into the classical model which is based
	on either-or thinking. It has to be widened into a continuum model
	by taking over elements of fuzzy logic and fractal geometry to accommodate
	for lineages such as the Podostemaceae.},

	meristems and is a key target in the control of meristem stability.
	The development of a determinate floral meristem is initiated by
	APETALA1/CAULIFLOWER (AP1/CAL) and LEAFY (LFY). The latter activates
	AGAMOUS (AG), partly in co-operation with WUS. AG then directs the
	development of the innermost floral organs and at the same time antagonizes
	WUS to terminate the meristem, although the mechanism of WUS repression
	remains unknown. All these genes participate in a series of regulatory

	has been put forward many times, based on a biological premise that

	sequence changes. {H}owever, to date several studies have voiced
	conflicting views on the presence or absence of such a relationship.
	{RESULTS}: {H}ere we perform a large scale study over multiple data
	sets in order to demonstrate that the major reason for conflict between
	previous studies is the use of different but overlapping datasets.
	{W}e show that lack of correlation, between evolutionary rate and
	number of interactions in a data set is related to the error rate.
	{W}e also demonstrate that the correlation is not an artifact of
	the underlying distributions of evolutionary distance and interactions
	and is therefore likely to be biologically relevant. {F}urther to
	this, we consider the claim that the dependence is due to gene expression
	levels and find some supporting evidence. {A} strong and positive
	correlation between the number of interactions and the age of a protein
	is also observed and we show this relationship is independent to
	expression levels. {CONCLUSIONS}: {A} correlation between number
	of interactions and evolutionary rate is observed but is dependent
	on the accuracy of the dataset being used. {H}owever it appears that
	the number of interactions a protein participates in depends more
	on the age of the protein than the rate at which it changes.},

	a novel method for feature subset selection applied to splice site
	prediction, based on estimation of distribution algorithms, a more
	general framework of genetic algorithms. {F}rom the estimated distribution
	of the algorithm, a feature ranking is derived. {A}fterwards this
	ranking is used to iteratively discard features. {W}e apply this
	technique to the problem of splice site prediction, and show how
	it can be used to gain insight into the underlying biological process
	of splicing. {CONCLUSION}: {W}e show that this technique proves to
	be more robust than the traditional use of estimation of distribution
	algorithms for feature selection: instead of returning a single best
	subset of features (as they normally do) this method provides a dynamical
	view of the feature selection process, like the traditional sequential
	wrapper methods. {H}owever, the method is faster than the traditional
	techniques, and scales better to datasets described by a large number
	of features.},

  month = {Nov},
  abstract = {Background Environmental conditions, such as water supply, temperature
	and salinity, strongly affect plant growth and development. Extremes
	of these conditions (abiotic stresses) adversely affect many different
	mechanisms associated with plant responses and adaptation to stress:
	photosynthetic mechanisms, e.g. stomatal control of CO(2) diffusion,
	photosystem II repair, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase
	(Rubisco) activity and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
	are susceptible to damage, and photosynthetic efficiency can be greatly
	decreased. Responses and adaptations require differential gene expression,
	which is regulated by specific transcription factors (TFs). Scope
	The role and regulation of several TFs involved in abiotic stress
	response pathways are considered, with emphasis on new findings regarding
	expression of genes related to both stomatal and non-stomatal limitations
	to CO(2) photosynthetic assimilation. Conclusions Many TFs, belonging
	to different families (e.g. MYB, bZIP and DREB), have been related
	to abiotic stress responses; however, only a few are known to regulate
	the expression of photosynthesis-related genes in response to stress.
	Several TFs belonging to the MYB family play an important role in
	both stomatal and non-stomatal responses by regulation of stomatal
	numbers and sizes, and metabolic components, respectively. To obtain
	more insight into this area of potentially large agronomic impact,
	it is essential to identify and functionally characterize new TFs
	that mediate the stress responses regulating the expression of genes
	associated with photosynthesis and related metabolism.},

	used with some success in simple organisms like yeast. {H}owever,
	as we move to higher organisms with more complex genomes, more sensitive
	methods are needed. {S}everal recent methods try to integrate additional
	sources of information, including microarray experiments (gene expression
	and {C}h{IP}-chip). {T}here is also a growing awareness that regulatory
	elements work in combination, and that this combinatorial behavior
	must be modeled for successful motif discovery. {H}owever, the multitude
	of methods and approaches makes it difficult to get a good understanding
	of the current status of the field. {RESULTS}: {T}his paper presents
	a survey of methods for motif discovery in {DNA}, based on a structured
	and well defined framework that integrates all relevant elements.
	{E}xisting methods are discussed according to this framework. {CONCLUSION}:
	{T}he survey shows that although no single method takes all relevant
	elements into consideration, a very large number of different models
	treating the various elements separately have been tried. {V}ery
	often the choices that have been made are not explicitly stated,
	making it difficult to compare different implementations. {A}lso,
	the tests that have been used are often not comparable. {T}herefore,

  abstract = {Tree thinking is an integral part of modern evolutionary biology,
	and a necessary precondition for phylogenetics and comparative analyses.
	Tree thinking has during the 20th century largely replaced group
	thinking, developmental thinking and anthropocentrism in biology.
	Unfortunately, however, this does not imply that tree thinking can
	be taken for granted. The findings reported here indicate that tree
	thinking is very much an acquired ability which needs extensive training.
	I tested a sample of undergraduate and graduate students of biology
	by means of questionnaires. Not a single student was able to correctly
	interpret a simple tree drawing. Several other findings demonstrate
	that tree thinking is virtually absent in students unless they are
	explicitly taught how to read evolutionary trees. Possible causes
	and implications of this mental bias are discussed. It seems that
	biological textbooks can be an important source of confusion for
	students. While group and developmental thinking have disappeared
	from most textual representations of evolution, they have survived
	in the evolutionary tree drawings of many textbooks. It is quite
	common for students to encounter anthropocentric trees and even trees
	containing stem groups and paraphyla. While these biases originate
	from the unconscious philosophical assumptions made by authors, the
	findings suggest that presenting unbiased evolutionary trees in biological
	publications is not merely a philosophical virtue but has also clear
	practical implications.},

	themselves against retroviruses. One of these, TRIM5alpha, can restrict
	diverse retroviruses in a species-specific manner. Thus, whereas
	rhesus TRIM5alpha can strongly restrict HIV-1, human TRIM5alpha only
	has weak HIV-1 restriction. The biology of TRIM5alpha restriction
	suggests that it is locked in an antagonistic conflict with the proteins
	encoding the viral capsid. Such antagonistic interactions frequently
	result in rapid amino acid replacements at the protein-protein interface,
	as each genetic entity vies for evolutionary dominance. By analyzing
	its evolutionary history, we find strong evidence for ancient positive
	selection in the primate TRIM5alpha gene. This selection is strikingly
	variable with some of the strongest selection occurring in the human
	lineage. This history suggests that TRIM5alpha evolution has been
	driven by antagonistic interactions with a wide variety of viruses
	and endogenous retroviruses that predate the origin of primate lentiviruses.
	A 13-aa "patch" in the SPRY protein domain bears a dense concentration
	of positively selected residues, potentially implicating it as an
	antiviral interface. By using functional studies of chimeric TRIM5alpha
	genes, we show that this patch is generally essential for retroviral
	restriction and is responsible for most of the species-specific antiretroviral
	restriction activity. Our study highlights the power of evolutionary
	analyses, in which positive selection identifies not only the age
	of genetic conflict but also the interaction interface where this
	conflict plays out.},

	a priori to be linear, the possible nonlinear nature might not be
	evident in specific aspects of their dynamics. {T}he method of surrogate
	data has become a very popular tool to address such a question. {H}owever,
	while it was meant to provide a statistically rigorous, foolproof
	framework, some limitations and caveats have shown up in its practical
	use. {I}n this paper, recent efforts to understand the caveats, avoid
	the pitfalls, and to overcome some of the limitations, are reviewed
	and augmented by new material. {I}n particular, we will discuss specific
	as well as more general approaches to constrained randomisation,
	providing a full range of examples. {N}ew algorithms will be introduced
	for unevenly sampled and multivariate data and for surrogate spike
	trains. {T}he main limitation, which lies in the interpretability
	of the test results, will be illustrated through instructive case
	studies. {W}e will also discuss some implementational aspects of
	the realisation of these methods in the {TISEAN} (this http {URL})

  abstract = {A{BSTRACT}: {BACKGROUND}: {T}he {V}iridiplantae (land plants and green
	algae) consist of two monophyletic lineages, the {C}hlorophyta and
	the {S}treptophyta. {T}he {S}treptophyta include all embryophytes
	and a small but diverse group of freshwater algae traditionally known
	as the {C}harophyceae (e.g. {C}harales, {C}oleochaete and the {Z}ygnematales).
	{T}he only flagellate currently included in the {S}treptophyta is
	{M}esostigma viride {L}auterborn. {T}o gain insight into the genome
	evolution in streptophytes, we have sequenced 10,395 {EST}s from
	{M}esostigma representing 3,300 independent contigs and compared
	the {EST}s of {M}esostigma with available plant genomes ({A}rabidopsis,
	{O}ryza, {C}hlamydomonas), with {EST}s from the bryophyte {P}hyscomitrella,
	the genome of the rhodophyte {C}yanidioschyzon, the {EST}s from the
	rhodophyte {P}orphyra, and the genome of the diatom {T}halassiosira.
	{RESULTS}: {T}he number of expressed genes shared by {M}esostigma
	with the embryophytes (90.3 \% of the expressed genes showing similarity
	to known proteins) is higher than with {C}hlamydomonas (76.1 \%).
	{I}n general, cytosolic metabolic pathways, and proteins involved
	in vesicular transport, transcription, regulation, {DNA}-structure
	and replication, cell cycle control, and {RNA}-metabolism are more
	conserved between {M}esostigma and the embryophytes than between
	{M}esostigma and {C}hlamydomonas. {H}owever, plastidic and mitochondrial
	metabolic pathways, cytoskeletal proteins and proteins involved in
	protein folding are more conserved between {M}esostigma and {C}hlamydomonas
	than between {M}esostigma and the embryophytes. {CONCLUSION}: {O}ur
	{EST}-analysis of {M}esostigma supports the notion that this organism
	should be a suitable unicellular model for the last flagellate common
	ancestor of the streptophytes. {M}esostigma shares more genes with
	the embryophytes than with the chlorophyte {C}hlamydomonas reinhardtii,
	although both organisms are flagellate unicells. {T}hus, it seems
	likely that several major physiological changes (e.g. in the regulation
	of photosynthesis and photorepiration) took place early during the
	evolution of streptophytes, i.e. before the transition to land.},

	culturally transmitted and symbolic. {I}n this paper {I} present
	an investigation into the factors involved in the evolution of such
	vocabulary systems. {I} investigate both the cultural evolution of
	vocabulary systems and the biological evolution of learning rules
	for vocabulary acquisition. {F}irstly, vocabularies are shown to
	evolve on a cultural time-scale so as to fit the expectations of
	learners-a population's vocabulary adapts to the biases of the learners
	in that population. {A} learning bias in favour of one-to-one mappings
	between meanings and words leads to the cultural evolution of communicatively
	optimal vocabulary systems, even in the absence of any explicit pressure
	for communication. {F}urthermore, the pressure to conform to the
	biases of learners is shown to outweigh natural selection acting
	on cultural transmission. {H}uman language learners appear to bring
	a one-to-one bias to the acquisition of vocabulary systems. {T}he
	functionality of human vocabulary may therefore be a consequence
	of the biases of human language learners. {S}econdly, the evolutionary
	stability of genetically transmitted vocabulary learning biases is
	investigated using both static and dynamic models. {A} one-to-one
	learning bias, which leads to the cultural evolution of optimal communication,
	is shown to be evolutionarily stable. {H}owever, the evolution de
	novo of this bias is complicated by the cumulative nature of the
	cultural evolution of vocabulary systems. {T}his suggests that the

	derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression
	in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical

	model of {L}onnstedt and {S}peed (2002) into a practical approach
	for general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments
	and {RNA} samples. {T}he model is reset in the context of general
	linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest.
	{T}he approach applies equally well to both single channel and two
	color microarray experiments. {C}onsistent, closed form estimators
	are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. {T}he estimators
	proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and
	allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality
	weights. {T}he posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms
	of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations
	are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. {T}he empirical
	{B}ayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample
	variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable
	inference when the number of arrays is small. {T}he use of moderated
	t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number
	of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular,
	knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required.
	{T}he moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with
	augmented degrees of freedom. {T}he moderated t inferential approach
	extends to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through
	the use of moderated {F}-statistics. {T}he performance of the methods
	is demonstrated in a simulation study. {R}esults are presented for

	as the number of genes that they have in common divided by their

	such, it takes a position intermediate to phylogenies based on single

  abstract = {Complex networks have been studied extensively owing to their relevance
	to many real systems such as the world-wide web, the {I}nternet,
	energy landscapes and biological and social networks. {A} large number
	of real networks are referred to as 'scale-free' because they show
	a power-law distribution of the number of links per node. {H}owever,
	it is widely believed that complex networks are not invariant or
	self-similar under a length-scale transformation. {T}his conclusion
	originates from the 'small-world' property of these networks, which
	implies that the number of nodes increases exponentially with the
	'diameter' of the network, rather than the power-law relation expected
	for a self-similar structure. {H}ere we analyse a variety of real
	complex networks and find that, on the contrary, they consist of
	self-repeating patterns on all length scales. {T}his result is achieved
	by the application of a renormalization procedure that coarse-grains
	the system into boxes containing nodes within a given 'size'. {W}e
	identify a power-law relation between the number of boxes needed
	to cover the network and the size of the box, defining a finite self-similar
	exponent. {T}hese fundamental properties help to explain the scale-free
	nature of complex networks and suggest a common self-organization

	{W}ith the size of available datasets steadily increasing, it has
	become feasible to consider other, more general, definitions as well.
	{O}ne alternative, based on information theory, is the mutual information,

	the use of mutual information in cluster analysis and visualization

	the earlier studies did not focus on comparing different algorithms

	we describe and review several approaches to estimate the mutual

	that the emergent correlations can be interpreted as a 'fingerprint'
	of the underlying biophysical system. {T}his result leads to a systematic
	relationship between observed correlation networks and the underlying
	biochemical pathways. {I}n a second step, we investigate to what
	extent our result is applicable to the problem of reverse engineering,

  abstract = {Ceramide-1-phosphate is a sphingolipid metabolite that has been implicated
	in membrane fusion of brain synaptic vesicles and neutrophil phagolysosome
	formation. Ceramide-1-phosphate can be produced by ATP-dependent
	ceramide kinase activity, although little is known of this enzyme
	because it has not yet been highly purified or cloned. Based on sequence
	homology to sphingosine kinase type 1, we have now cloned a related
	lipid kinase, human ceramide kinase (hCERK). hCERK encodes a protein
	of 537 amino acids that has a catalytic region with a high degree
	of similarity to the diacylglycerol kinase catalytic domain. hCERK
	also has a putative N-myristoylation site on its NH(2) terminus followed
	by a pleckstrin homology domain. Membrane but not cytosolic fractions
	from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with a hCERK expression
	vector readily phosphorylated ceramide but not sphingosine or other
	sphingoid bases, diacylglycerol or phosphatidylinositol. This activity
	was clearly distinguished from those of bacterial or human diacylglycerol
	kinases. With natural ceramide as a substrate, the enzyme had a pH
	optimum of 6.0-7.5 and showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with K(m)
	values of 187 and 32 microm for ceramide and ATP, respectively. Northern
	blot analysis revealed that hCERK mRNA expression was high in the
	brain, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver. A BLAST search
	analysis using the hCERK sequence revealed that putative ceramide
	kinases (CERKs) exist widely in diverse multicellular organisms including
	plants, nematodes, insects, and vertebrates. Phylogenetic analysis
	revealed that CERKs are a new class of lipid kinases that are clearly
	distinct from sphingosine and diacylglycerol kinases. Cloning of
	CERK should provide new molecular tools to investigate the physiological
	functions of ceramide-1-phosphate.},

	developed acute hemiparesis that progressed to triplegia without
	evidence of central nervous system involvement. RESULTS: Nerve conduction
	studies, electromyography, and muscle biopsy revealed the typical
	features of necrotizing myopathy with loss of thick filaments. CONCLUSIONS:
	This case demonstrates that high-dose corticosteroid therapy can
	induce asymmetrical myopathic weakness. Hemiplegia evolving to triplegia
	in a setting of corticosteroid treatment could potentially misdirect
	the diagnosis toward a lesion of the brain or spinal cord. When a

	44 women with confirmed breast cancers were imaged with a high-resolution
	PEM scanner (Naviscan PET Systems, Rockville, MD) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose.
	The images were blindly evaluated and were compared with final pathology.
	RESULTS: The majority of the index lesions were seen on PEM (89\%,
	39/44). PEM detected 4 of 5 incidental breast cancers, 3 of which
	were not seen by any other imaging modalities. Of 19 patients undergoing
	breast-conserving surgery, PEM correctly predicted 6 of 8 (75\%)
	patients with positive margins and 100\% (11/11) with negative margins.
	CONCLUSION: The current PEM device shows promise in detecting breast
	malignancies and may assist in the planning of adequate partial mastectomy
	procedures to better ensure negative margins.},

	{W}e find that standard wheat germ extract contains {D}icer-like
	enzymes that convert double-stranded {RNA} (ds{RNA}) into two classes
	of small interfering {RNA}s, as well as an {RNA}-dependent {RNA}

	into ds{RNA}. {I}n this plant embryo extract, an endogenous micro{RNA}
	(mi{RNA}) that lacks perfect complementarity to its {RNA} targets
	nonetheless acts as a small interfering {RNA}. {T}he mi{RNA} guides
	an endonuclease to cleave efficiently wild-type {A}rabidopsis {PHAVOLUTA}

	development. {T}his finding supports the view that plant mi{RNA}s
	direct {RNA}i and that mi{RNA}-specified m{RNA} destruction is important

	Gene duplication, gene loss and speciation in combination with differential

	that require additional terms beyond homology for a proper description.
	Use and possible misuse of these terms, including "orthology", "paralogy"

	This MADS-box gene subfamily demonstrates that homologous genes in
	different species with (almost) identical functions can be paralogues
	rather than orthologues, corroborating that functional similarity
	of genes is not a valid criterion for orthology. Homeosis fails some
	tests of homology, but might be of greater evolutionary importance
	than previously assumed, justifying yet another term, "homocracy".
	It describes organs that share the expression of the same patterning
	genes, irrespective of the homology of these organs. All in all this

  abstract = {Universal common ancestry (UCA) is a central pillar of modern evolutionary
	theory. As first suggested by Darwin, the theory of UCA posits that
	all extant terrestrial organisms share a common genetic heritage,
	each being the genealogical descendant of a single species from the
	distant past. The classic evidence for UCA, although massive, is
	largely restricted to 'local' common ancestry-for example, of specific
	phyla rather than the entirety of life-and has yet to fully integrate
	the recent advances from modern phylogenetics and probability theory.
	Although UCA is widely assumed, it has rarely been subjected to formal
	quantitative testing, and this has led to critical commentary emphasizing
	the intrinsic technical difficulties in empirically evaluating a
	theory of such broad scope. Furthermore, several researchers have
	proposed that early life was characterized by rampant horizontal
	gene transfer, leading some to question the monophyly of life. Here
	I provide the first, to my knowledge, formal, fundamental test of
	UCA, without assuming that sequence similarity implies genetic kinship.
	I test UCA by applying model selection theory to molecular phylogenies,
	focusing on a set of ubiquitously conserved proteins that are proposed
	to be orthologous. Among a wide range of biological models involving
	the independent ancestry of major taxonomic groups, the model selection
	tests are found to overwhelmingly support UCA irrespective of the
	presence of horizontal gene transfer and symbiotic fusion events.
	These results provide powerful statistical evidence corroborating
	the monophyly of all known life.},

  year = {2009},

  pages = {163},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Senescence is integral to the flowering plant life-cycle.
	Senescence-like processes occur also in non-angiosperm land plants,
	algae and photosynthetic prokaryotes. Increasing numbers of genes
	have been assigned functions in the regulation and execution of angiosperm
	senescence. At the same time there has been a large expansion in
	the number and taxonomic spread of plant sequences in the genome
	databases. The present paper uses these resources to make a study
	of the evolutionary origins of angiosperm senescence based on a survey
	of the distribution, across plant and microbial taxa, and expression
	of senescence-related genes. RESULTS: Phylogeny analyses were carried
	out on protein sequences corresponding to genes with demonstrated
	functions in angiosperm senescence. They include proteins involved
	in chlorophyll catabolism and its control, homeoprotein transcription
	factors, metabolite transporters, enzymes and regulators of carotenoid
	metabolism and of anthocyanin biosynthesis. Evolutionary timelines
	for the origins and functions of particular genes were inferred from
	the taxonomic distribution of sequences homologous to those of angiosperm
	senescence-related proteins. Turnover of the light energy transduction
	apparatus is the most ancient element in the senescence syndrome.
	By contrast, the association of phenylpropanoid metabolism with senescence,
	and integration of senescence with development and adaptation mediated
	by transcription factors, are relatively recent innovations of land
	plants. An extended range of senescence-related genes of Arabidopsis
	was profiled for coexpression patterns and developmental relationships
	and revealed a clear carotenoid metabolism grouping, coordinated
	expression of genes for anthocyanin and flavonoid enzymes and regulators
	and a cluster pattern of genes for chlorophyll catabolism consistent
	with functional and evolutionary features of the pathway. CONCLUSION:
	The expression and phylogenetic characteristics of senescence-related
	genes allow a framework to be constructed of decisive events in the
	evolution of the senescence syndrome of modern land-plants. Combining
	phylogenetic, comparative sequence, gene expression and morphogenetic
	information leads to the conclusion that biochemical, cellular, integrative
	and adaptive systems were progressively added to the ancient primary
	core process of senescence as the evolving plant encountered new
	environmental and developmental contexts.},

	are a useful coarse graining of the spatial structure, since they
	cover most of the free energy of folding, they are conserved during
	evolution and have been used successfully to interpret {RNA} function.
	{M}oreover they are computationally easy to handle, because only
	discrete base pair patterns (no coordinates) are considered. {W}e
	combined phylogenetic and thermodynamic information to search for
	evolutionarily conserved secondary structure motifs in the genomic
	{RNA}s of the family {F}laviviridae. {T}his family consists of the
	three genera {F}lavivirus, {P}estivirus, {H}epacivirus, and the group
	of {GB} virus {C}/hepatitis {G} virus with a currently uncertain
	taxonomic classification. {T}he main findings of our survey are strong
	hints for the possibility of genome cyclization in hepatitis {C}
	virus and {GB} virus {C}, as it has been proposed previously for
	the members of the genus {F}laviviruses, a surprisingly large number
	of conserved {RNA} motifs in the coding regions, and a lower level
	of detailed structural conservation of the motifs in the {I}nternal
	{R}ibosomal {E}ntry {S}ites and 3 untranslated regions than reported
	in the literature. {P}seudoknots are normally excluded from secondary
	structure by definition, yet they are occasionally functionally important.
	{T}herefore, in the second part of this thesis the secondary structure
	detection algorithm was extended to allow for prediction of some
	restricted kinds of pseudoknots. {T}he algorithm is tested on three
	kinds of {RNA}s which are known to contain pseudoknots. {T}hese are
	{S}ignal recognition particle {RNA}, ribonuclease {P} {RNA} and tm{RNA}.
	{I}n order to evaluate the predicted secondary structures we had
	to compare our data to experimental results contained in the literature.
	{T}he search for literature containing the specific information resulted
	in a very time consuming task. {T}herefore we created an automated

	with computer scientists from the university of {L}eipzig. {P}ubmed

	transcription factors that bind as dimers to specific {DNA} target
	sites and that have been well characterized in nonplant eukaryotes
	as important regulatory components in diverse biological processes.
	{B}ased on evidence that the b{HLH} protein {PIF}3 is a direct phytochrome
	reaction partner in the photoreceptor's signaling network, we have
	undertaken a comprehensive computational analysis of the {A}rabidopsis
	genome sequence databases to define the scope and features of the
	b{HLH} family. {U}sing a set of criteria derived from a previously
	defined consensus motif, we identified 147 b{HLH} protein-encoding
	genes, making this one of the largest transcription factor families
	in {A}rabidopsis. {P}hylogenetic analysis of the b{HLH} domain sequences
	permits classification of these genes into 21 subfamilies. {T}he
	evolutionary and potential functional relationships implied by this
	analysis are supported by other criteria, including the chromosomal
	distribution of these genes relative to duplicated genome segments,
	the conservation of variant exon/intron structural patterns, and
	the predicted {DNA} binding activities within subfamilies. {C}onsiderable
	diversity in {DNA} binding site specificity among family members
	is predicted, and marked divergence in protein sequence outside of
	the conserved b{HLH} domain is observed. {T}ogether with the established
	propensity of b{HLH} factors to engage in varying degrees of homodimerization
	and heterodimerization, these observations suggest that the {A}rabidopsis
	b{HLH} proteins have the potential to participate in an extensive
	set of combinatorial interactions, endowing them with the capacity
	to be involved in the regulation of a multiplicity of transcriptional
	programs. {W}e provide evidence from yeast two-hybrid and in vitro
	binding assays that two related phytochrome-interacting members in
	the {A}rabidopsis family, {PIF}3 and {PIF}4, can form both homodimers
	and heterodimers and that all three dimeric configurations can bind
	specifically to the {G}-box {DNA} sequence motif {CACGTG}. {T}hese
	data are consistent, in principle, with the operation of this combinatorial
	mechanism in {A}rabidopsis.},

	localization sequences ({NLS}s) which consist of short stretches
	of basic amino acids that are part of the structure of mature nuclear
	proteins. {T}wo {NLS}s have been previously identified in the maize
	regulatory protein {O}paque2 ({O}2), a member of the basic-domain,
	leucine-zipper (b{ZIP}) class of proteins. {I}n this report, it has
	been determined that both of these {NLS}s are necessary for import
	of {O}2, and the focus has been on a functional analysis of the more
	efficient, bipartite {NLS} that is present in the basic or {DNA}-binding
	domain. {A} mutation which contains altered amino acids on both parts
	of this {NLS} severely reduced nuclear targeting, and led to the
	definition of two classes of bipartite {NLS}s. {S}ince the bipartite
	{NLS} is located in the highly conserved. {DNA}-binding domain, the
	dual role of this domain was examined using the maize mutant o2-676,
	in which a conservative mutation eliminates the {DNA}-binding function.
	{T}he o2-676 protein localized to the nucleus in maize and the b{ZIP}
	domain from the mutant protein was sufficient to redirect a reporter
	protein to the nucleus in transgenic plant cells. {T}hus, it was
	possible to show that the nuclear targeting function of this domain
	is independent of {DNA} binding. {S}equence conservation of the basic
	domain of other b{ZIP} proteins suggests that the bifunctionality
	of this domain may be conserved in all members of this class; a consensus
	sequence for a bipartite {NLS} in b{ZIP} proteins is suggested.},

  abstract = {B{ACKGROUND}: {W}orldwide, grapes and their derived products have
	a large market. {T}he cultivated grape species {V}itis vinifera has
	potential to become a model for fruit trees genetics. {L}ike many
	plant species, it is highly heterozygous, which is an additional
	challenge to modern whole genome shotgun sequencing. {I}n this paper
	a high quality draft genome sequence of a cultivated clone of {V}.
	vinifera {P}inot {N}oir is presented. {PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS}: {W}e
	estimate the genome size of {V}. vinifera to be 504.6 {M}b. {G}enomic
	sequences corresponding to 477.1 {M}b were assembled in 2,093 metacontigs
	and 435.1 {M}b were anchored to the 19 linkage groups ({LG}s). {T}he
	number of predicted genes is 29,585, of which 96.1\% were assigned
	to {LG}s. {T}his assembly of the grape genome provides candidate
	genes implicated in traits relevant to grapevine cultivation, such
	as those influencing wine quality, via secondary metabolites, and
	those connected with the extreme susceptibility of grape to pathogens.
	{S}ingle nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) distribution was consistent
	with a diffuse haplotype structure across the genome. {O}f around
	2,000,000 {SNP}s, 1,751,176 were mapped to chromosomes and one or
	more of them were identified in 86.7\% of anchored genes. {T}he relative
	age of grape duplicated genes was estimated and this made possible
	to reveal a relatively recent {V}itis-specific large scale duplication
	event concerning at least 10 chromosomes (duplication not reported
	before). {CONCLUSIONS}: {S}anger shotgun sequencing and highly efficient
	sequencing by synthesis ({SBS}), together with dedicated assembly
	programs, resolved a complex heterozygous genome. {A} consensus sequence
	of the genome and a set of mapped marker loci were generated. {H}omologous
	chromosomes of {P}inot {N}oir differ by 11.2\% of their {DNA} (hemizygous
	{DNA} plus chromosomal gaps). {SNP} markers are offered as a tool
	with the potential of introducing a new era in the molecular breeding

  abstract = {M{OTIVATION}: {T}he phylogenetic profile of a protein is a string
	that encodes the presence or absence of the protein in every fully

	structural complex or metabolic pathway are likely to evolve in a
	correlated fashion, the phylogenetic profiles of such proteins are
	often 'similar' or at least 'related' to each other. {T}he question
	we address in this paper is the following: how to measure the 'similarity'
	between two profiles, in an evolutionarily relevant way, in order
	to develop efficient function prediction methods? {RESULTS}: {W}e
	show how the profiles can be mapped to a high-dimensional vector
	space which incorporates evolutionarily relevant information, and
	we provide an algorithm to compute efficiently the inner product
	in that space, which we call the tree kernel. {T}he tree kernel can
	be used by any kernel-based analysis method for classification or
	data mining of phylogenetic profiles. {A}s an application a {S}upport
	{V}ector {M}achine ({SVM}) trained to predict the functional class
	of a gene from its phylogenetic profile is shown to perform better
	with the tree kernel than with a naive kernel that does not include
	any information about the phylogenetic relationships among species.

	phylogenetic profiles illustrates the sensitivity of the tree kernel
	to evolutionarily relevant variations.},

	data, the primary sequences of the {DNA} and proteins, the microarray
	based gene expression data, and other functional genomics data. {T}he
	main contribution is the development of the pattern discovery algorithm
	{SPEXS}, accompanied by several practical applications for analyzing
	real biological problems. {F}or performing these biological studies
	that integrate different types of biological data we have developed
	a comprehensive web-based biological data analysis environment {E}xpression
	{P}ro- filer (http://ep.ebi.ac.uk/). {B}iosequences, i.e., the primary
	sequences of {DNA}, {RNA}, and protein molecules, represent the most
	basic type of biological information. {F}eatures of these sequences
	that are reused by nature help us to understand better the basic
	mechanisms of gene structure, function, and regulation. {T}he {SPEXS}
	algorithm has been developed for the discovery of the biologically
	relevant features that can be represented in the form of sequence
	patterns. {SPEXS} is a fast exhaustive search algorithm for the class
	of generalized regular patterns. {T}his class is essentially the
	same as used in the {PROSITE} pattern database, i.e. it allows patterns
	to consist of fixed character positions, group character positions
	(ambiguities), and wildcards of variable lengths. {T}he biological
	relevance of the patterns can be estimated according to several different
	mathematical criteria, which have to be chosen according to the application.
	{W}e have used {SPEXS} for the analysis of real biological problems,
	where we have been able to find biologically meaningful patterns
	in a variety of different applications. {F}or example, we have studied
	gene regulation mechanisms by a systematic prediction of transcription
	factor binding sites or other signals in the {DNA}. {I}n order to
	find genes that potentially share common regulatory mechanisms, we
	haveused microarray based gene expression data for extracting sets
	of coexpressed genes. {W}e have also demonstrated that it is possible
	to predict the type of interaction between the {G}-protein coupled
	receptors ({GPCR}) and its respective {G}-protein, the mechanism
	widelyused by cells for signaling pathways. {T}hat prediction, although
	the {GPCR}s have been studied for decades, primarily for their immense
	value for the pharmaceutical industry, had been thought to be unlikely
	from the primary sequence of {GPCR} alone. {T}he tools developed
	for various practical analysis tasks have been integrated into a
	web-based data mining environment {E}xpression {P}rofiler hosted
	at the {E}uropean {B}ioinformatics {I}nstitute {EBI}.{W}ith the tools
	in {E}xpression {P}rofiler it is possible to analyze a range of different

	of work on alignment-free sequence has taken place in the past two
	decades, with most reports published in the past 5 years. {T}wo main
	categories of methods have been proposed-methods based on word (oligomer)

	the statistics of word frequency, on the distances defined in a {C}artesian

	{D}omain duplication and shuffling by recombination are probably

  abstract = {B{ACKGROUND}: {P}hylogenetic footprinting is the identification of
	functional regions of {DNA} by their evolutionary conservation. {T}his
	is achieved by comparing orthologous regions from multiple species
	and identifying the {DNA} regions that have diverged less than neutral
	{DNA}. {V}estige is a phylogenetic footprinting package built on
	the {P}y{E}volve toolkit that uses probabilistic molecular evolutionary
	modelling to represent aspects of sequence evolution, including the
	conventional divergence measure employed by other footprinting approaches.
	{I}n addition to measuring the divergence, {V}estige allows the expansion
	of the definition of a phylogenetic footprint to include variation
	in the distribution of any molecular evolutionary processes. {T}his
	is achieved by displaying the distribution of model parameters that
	represent partitions of molecular evolutionary substitutions. {E}xamination
	of the spatial incidence of these effects across regions of the genome
	can identify {DNA} segments that differ in the nature of the evolutionary
	process. {RESULTS}: {V}estige was applied to a reference dataset
	of the {SCL} locus from four species and provided clear identification
	of the known conserved regions in this dataset. {T}o demonstrate
	the flexibility to use diverse models of molecular evolution and
	dissect the nature of the evolutionary process {V}estige was used
	to footprint the {K}a/{K}s ratio in primate {BRCA}1 with a codon
	model of evolution. {T}wo regions of putative adaptive evolution
	were identified illustrating the ability of {V}estige to represent
	the spatial distribution of distinct molecular evolutionary processes.
	{CONCLUSIONS}: {V}estige provides a flexible, open platform for phylogenetic
	footprinting. {U}nderpinned by the {P}y{E}volve toolkit, {V}estige
	provides a framework for visualising the signatures of evolutionary
	processes across the genome of numerous organisms simultaneously.
	{B}y exploiting the maximum-likelihood statistical framework, the

	selection can be evaluated both spatially (along a sequence alignment)
	and temporally (for each branch of the tree) providing visual indicators

	Over the past 20 years, many algorithms have been developed to tackle
	the motif finding problem computationally. The PhyloCon algorithm,
	developed in 2003, is one of the first motif finding algorithms that
	take advantage of two important data resources, i.e., phylogenetic
	conservation and gene co-regulation, to improve the efficiency of
	motif identification in biological datasets. This unit presents basic
	protocols to obtain, install, and apply the PhyloCon program and
	discusses the underlying algorithm and how to interpret the results.},

  abstract = {B{ACKGROUND}: {N}atural antisense transcripts ({NAT}) are a class
	of endogenous coding or non-protein-coding {RNA}s with sequence complementarity
	to other transcripts. {S}everal lines of evidence have shown that
	cis- and trans-{NAT}s may participate in a broad range of gene regulatory
	events. {G}enome-wide identification of cis-{NAT}s in human, mouse
	and rice has revealed their widespread occurrence in eukaryotes.
	{H}owever, little is known about cis-{NAT}s in the model plant {A}rabidopsis
	thaliana. {RESULTS}: {W}e developed a new computational method to
	predict and identify cis-encoded {NAT}s in {A}rabidopsis and found
	1,340 potential {NAT} pairs. {T}he expression of both sense and antisense
	transcripts of 957 {NAT} pairs was confirmed using {A}rabidopsis
	full-length c{DNA}s and public massively parallel signature sequencing
	({MPSS}) data. {T}hree known or putative {A}rabidopsis imprinted
	genes have cis-antisense transcripts. {S}equences and the genomic
	arrangement of two {A}rabidopsis {NAT} pairs are conserved in rice.
	{CONCLUSION}: {W}e combined information from full-length c{DNA}s
	and {A}rabidopsis genome annotation in our {NAT} prediction work
	and reported cis-{NAT} pairs that could not otherwise be identified
	by using one of the two datasets only. {A}nalysis of {MPSS} data
	suggested that for most {A}rabidopsis cis-{NAT} pairs, there is predominant
	expression of one of the two transcripts in a tissue-specific manner.},

	(mi{RNA}s) interact with target m{RNA}s by sequence complementarity
	to regulate their expression. {T}he low abundance of some mi{RNA}s

	method for genome-wide prediction of {A}rabidopsis thaliana micro{RNA}s

	between mi{RNA}s and their target m{RNA}s is used to predict mi{RNA}-regulated
	{A}rabidopsis transcripts. {RESULTS}: {O}ur prediction covered 63\%

	for the expression of 25 predicted mi{RNA}s came from northern blots,

	modular structures, where links between nodes are much denser within

	networks are also modular, reflecting the relative independence and
	coherence of different functional units in a cell. {W}hile many authors
	have claimed that observations from the yeast protein-protein interaction
	({PPI}) network support the above hypothesis, the observed structural
	modularity may be an artifact because the current {PPI} data include
	interactions inferred from protein complexes through approaches that
	create modules (e.g., assigning pairwise interactions among all proteins
	in a complex). {H}ere we analyze the yeast {PPI} network including
	protein complexes ({PIC} network) and excluding complexes ({PEC}
	network). {W}e find that both {PIC} and {PEC} networks show a significantly
	greater structural modularity than that of randomly rewired networks.
	{N}onetheless, there is little evidence that the structural modules
	correspond to functional units, particularly in the {PEC} network.
	{M}ore disturbingly, there is no evolutionary conservation among
	yeast, fly, and nematode modules at either the whole-module or protein-pair
	level. {N}either is there a correlation between the evolutionary
	or phylogenetic conservation of a protein and the extent of its participation
	in various modules. {U}sing computer simulation, we demonstrate that
	a higher-than-expected modularity can arise during network growth
	through a simple model of gene duplication, without natural selection
	for modularity. {T}aken together, our results suggest the intriguing

	of gene expression in {HUVEC} exposed to laminar shear stress. {A}lthough
	the m{RNA} levels of {N}rf2 were unchanged during exposure to shear

	the expression of {N}rf2-regulated genes such as {HO}-1, {SQSTM}1,
	{NQO}1, glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit ({GCLM}), and
	ferritin heavy chain. {N}rf2 was rapidly degraded in cells treated

	{I}n order to understand how the present-day code came about we first
	need to explain how the language of the building plan can change

	a minimal organism model that is based on biophysically reasonable
	descriptions of {RNA} and protein, namely secondary structure folding
	and knowledge based potentials. {T}he evolution of a population of

	with very simple codes, and hence greatly reduced amino acid alphabets,
	we observe a diversification of the codes in most simulation runs.
	{T}he driving force behind this effect is the possibility to produce

	DNA only contains four different bases, means that the 'signal-to-noise
	ratio' in protein sequence alignments is much better than in alignments
	of DNA. Besides this information-theoretical advantage, protein alignments
	also benefit from the information that is implicit in empirical substitution
	matrices such as BLOSUM-62. Taken together with the generally higher
	rate of synonymous mutations over non-synonymous ones, this means
	that the phylogenetic signal disappears much more rapidly from DNA
	sequences than from the encoded proteins. It is therefore preferable
	to align coding DNA at the amino acid level and it is for this purpose
	we have constructed the program RevTrans. RevTrans constructs a multiple
	DNA alignment by: (i) translating the DNA; (ii) aligning the resulting
	peptide sequences; and (iii) building a multiple DNA alignment by
	'reverse translation' of the aligned protein sequences. In the resulting
	DNA alignment, gaps occur in groups of three corresponding to entire
	codons, and analogous codon positions are therefore always lined
	up. These features are useful when constructing multiple DNA alignments
	for phylogenetic analysis. RevTrans also accepts user-provided protein
	alignments for greater control of the alignment process. The RevTrans

  abstract = {Sugars have been shown to regulate transcription of numerous genes
	in plants. {S}ucrose controls translation of the group {S} basic
	region leucine zipper (b{ZIP})-type transcription factor {ATB}2/{A}tb{ZIP}11
	({R}ook et al., 1998a). {T}his control requires the unusually long
	5' untranslated region ({UTR}) of the gene. {P}oint mutations and
	deletions of the 5'{UTR} have uncovered the sequences involved. {A}
	highly conserved upstream open reading frame (u{ORF}) coding for
	42 amino acids is essential for the repression mechanism. {I}t is
	conserved in 5'{UTR}s of b{ZIP} transcription factors from other
	{A}rabidopsis thaliana genes and many other plants. {ATB}2/{A}tb{ZIP}11
	is normally expressed in association with vascular tissues. {E}ctopic
	expression of a 5'{UTR} construct shows that the sucrose repression
	system is functional in all tissues. {A}tb{ZIP}2 is another {A}rabidopsis
	b{ZIP} transcription factor gene harboring the conserved u{ORF},
	which is regulated similarly via sucrose-induced repression of translation.
	{T}his suggests a general function of the conserved u{ORF} in sucrose-controlled
	regulation of expression. {O}ur findings imply the operation of a
	sucrose-sensing pathway that controls translation of several plant
	b{ZIP} transcription factor genes harboring the conserved u{ORF}
	in their 5'{UTR}s. {T}arget genes of such transcription factors will
	then be regulated in sucrose-dependent way.},

	developed in population genetics, and that there is no disagreement
	between the population genetics of haploid, asexually-replicating

	theory and mutation-selection balance are two sides of the same medal,
	the discussion about which is more appropriate to describe virus
	evolution is moot. {I}n future work on virus evolution, we would
	do good to focus on the important questions, such as whether we can
	develop accurate, quantitative models of virus evolution, and to
	leave aside discussions about the relative merits of perfectly equivalent

	show that, for prokaryotic gene circuits dominated by local promoter
	control, dynamical system behavior descriptors like the number and
	stability of equilibrium point steady states and their bifurcation
	potential can be largely determined from genomic organization (e.g.
	the number, type, and placement of regulatory protein binding sites).
	{C}oncepts are illustrated on hypothetical gene regulation systems

	sites (operators). {G}ene regulatory systems with a single gene and
	an arbitrary number of operator sites are shown to be globally stable,

	from diverse taxa prompts the development of new phylogenetic approaches,
	which attempt to incorporate information derived from comparative
	analysis of complete gene sets or large subsets thereof. {S}uch attempts
	are particularly relevant because of the major role of horizontal
	gene transfer and lineage-specific gene loss, at least in the evolution
	of prokaryotes. {RESULTS}: {F}ive largely independent approaches
	were employed to construct trees for completely sequenced bacterial
	and archaeal genomes: i) presence-absence of genomes in clusters
	of orthologous genes; ii) conservation of local gene order (gene
	pairs) among prokaryotic genomes; iii) parameters of identity distribution
	for probable orthologs; iv) analysis of concatenated alignments of
	ribosomal proteins; v) comparison of trees constructed for multiple
	protein families. {A}ll constructed trees support the separation
	of the two primary prokaryotic domains, bacteria and archaea, as
	well as some terminal bifurcations within the bacterial and archaeal
	domains. {B}eyond these obvious groupings, the trees made with different
	methods appeared to differ substantially in terms of the relative
	contributions of phylogenetic relationships and similarities in gene
	repertoires caused by similar life styles and horizontal gene transfer
	to the tree topology. {T}he trees based on presence-absence of genomes
	in orthologous clusters and the trees based on conserved gene pairs
	appear to be strongly affected by gene loss and horizontal gene transfer.
	{T}he trees based on identity distributions for orthologs and particularly
	the tree made of concatenated ribosomal protein sequences seemed
	to carry a stronger phylogenetic signal. {T}he latter tree supported
	three potential high-level bacterial clades,: i) {C}hlamydia-{S}pirochetes,
	ii) {T}hermotogales-{A}quificales (bacterial hyperthermophiles),
	and ii) {A}ctinomycetes-{D}einococcales-{C}yanobacteria. {T}he latter
	group also appeared to join the low-{GC} {G}ram-positive bacteria
	at a deeper tree node. {T}hese new groupings of bacteria were supported
	by the analysis of alternative topologies in the concatenated ribosomal
	protein tree using the {K}ishino-{H}asegawa test and by a census
	of the topologies of 132 individual groups of orthologous proteins.
	{A}dditionally, the results of this analysis put into question the
	sister-group relationship between the two major archaeal groups,
	{E}uryarchaeota and {C}renarchaeota, and suggest instead that {E}uryarchaeota
	might be a paraphyletic group with respect to {C}renarchaeota. {CONCLUSIONS}:
	{W}e conclude that, the extensive horizontal gene flow and lineage-specific
	gene loss notwithstanding, extension of phylogenetic analysis to
	the genome scale has the potential of uncovering deep evolutionary
	relationships between prokaryotic lineages.},

  abstract = {In mammalian cells sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a well-established
	messenger molecule that participates in a wide range of signalling
	pathways. The objective of the work reported here was to investigate
	the extent to which phosphorylated long-chain sphingoid bases, such
	as sphingosine-1-phosphate and phytosphingosine-1-phosphate (phytoS1P)
	are used in plant cell signalling. To do this, we manipulated Arabidopsis
	genes capable of metabolizing these messenger molecules. We show
	that Sphingosine kinase1 (SPHK1) encodes an enzyme that phosphorylates
	sphingosine, phytosphingosine and other sphingoid long-chain bases.
	The stomata of SPHK1-KD Arabidopsis plants were less sensitive, whereas
	the stomata of SPHK1-OE plants were more sensitive, than wild type
	to ABA. The rate of germination of SPHK1-KD was enhanced, whereas
	the converse was true for SPHK1-OE seed. Reducing expression of either
	the putative Arabidopsis S1P phosphatase (SPPASE) or the DPL1 gene,
	which encodes an enzyme with S1P lyase activity, individually, had
	no effect on guard-cell ABA signalling; however, stomatal responses
	to ABA in SPPASEDPL1 RNAi plants were compromised. Reducing the expression
	of DPL1 had no effect on germination; however, germination of SPPASE
	RNAi seeds was more sensitive to applied ABA. We also found evidence
	that expression of SPHK1 and SPPASE were coordinately regulated,
	and discuss how this might contribute to robustness in guard-cell
	signalling. In summary, our data establish SPHK1 as a component in
	two separate plant signalling systems, opening the possibility that
	phosphorylated long-chain sphingoid bases such as S1P and phytoS1P
	are ubiquitous messengers in plants.},

	proteins play significant roles in responses to biotic and abiotic
	stresses, and in development. {I}n this research, we identified 102
	putative {WRKY} genes from the rice genome and compared them with

	were divided into three groups with several subgroups on the basis

	{T}he phylogenetic trees generated from the {WD}s and the genes indicate
	that the {WRKY} gene family arose during evolution through duplication

	{III} is due to tandem and segmental gene duplication compared with

	of the {WRKY} genes predate the divergence of monocots and dicots.
	{O}n the basis of these results, we believe that genes encoding a

	the floral identity protein LEAFY has strong non-autonomous effects
	when expressed in the epidermis, mediated by its movement into underlying
	tissue layers. By contrast, a structurally unrelated floral identity
	protein, APETALA1, has only limited non-autonomous effects. Using
	GFP fusions to monitor protein movement in the shoot apical meristem
	and in floral primordia of Arabidopsis, we found a strong correlation
	between cytoplasmic localization of proteins and their ability to
	move to adjacent cells. The graded distribution of several GFP fusions
	with their highest levels in the cells where they are produced is
	compatible with the notion that this movement is driven by diffusion.
	We also present evidence that protein movement is more restricted
	laterally within layers than it is from L1 into underlying layers
	of the Arabidopsis apex. Based on these observations, we propose
	that intercellular movement of transcription factors can occur in
	a non-targeted fashion as a result of simple diffusion. This hypothesis
	raises the possibility that diffusion is the default state for many
	macromolecules in the Arabidopsis apex, unless they are specifically

	recently uncovered a set of generic organizing principles: {M}ost
	of these systems are scale-free while at the same time modular, resulting

	network, where individual domains correspond to nodes and their co-occurrences
	in a protein are interpreted as links, also falls into this category,
	suggesting that domains involved in the maintenance of increasingly
	developed, multicellular organisms accumulate links. {H}ere, we take
	the next step by studying link based properties of the protein domain
	co-occurrence networks of the eukaryotes {S}. cerevisiae, {C}. elegans,
	{D}. melanogaster, {M}. musculus and {H}. sapiens. {RESULTS}: {W}e
	construct the protein domain co-occurrence networks from the {PFAM}
	database and analyze them by applying a k-core decomposition method
	that isolates the globally central (highly connected domains in the
	central cores) from the locally central (highly connected domains
	in the peripheral cores) protein domains through an iterative peeling
	process. {F}urthermore, we compare the subnetworks thus obtained
	to the physical domain interaction network of {S}. cerevisiae. {W}e
	find that the innermost cores of the domain co-occurrence networks
	gradually grow with increasing degree of evolutionary development
	in going from single cellular to multicellular eukaryotes. {T}he
	comparison of the cores across all the organisms under consideration
	uncovers patterns of domain combinations that are predominately involved
	in protein functions such as cell-cell contacts and signal transduction.
	{A}nalyzing a weighted interaction network of {PFAM} domains of yeast,
	we find that domains having only a few partners frequently interact
	with these, while the converse is true for domains with a multitude
	of partners. {C}ombining domain co-occurrence and interaction information,

	uncovers small, connected network patterns. {CONCLUSION}: {W}e hypothesize

	whose ground state structure is thermodynamically well defined show
	a significant tendency to buffer single point mutations. {T}his can

	percentage of false positives among all the claimed positives. {I}n
	practice, with the true {FDR} unknown, an estimated {FDR} can serve
	as a criterion to evaluate the performance of various statistical
	methods under the condition that the estimated {FDR} approximates
	the true {FDR} well, or at least, it does not improperly favor or
	disfavor any particular method. {P}ermutation methods have become
	popular to estimate {FDR} in genomic studies. {T}he purpose of this
	paper is 2-fold. {F}irst, we investigate theoretically and empirically
	whether the standard permutation-based {FDR} estimator is biased,
	and if so, whether the bias inappropriately favors or disfavors any
	method. {S}econd, we propose a simple modification of the standard
	permutation to yield a better {FDR} estimator, which can in turn
	serve as a more fair criterion to evaluate various statistical methods.
	{RESULTS}: {B}oth simulated and real data examples are used for illustration
	and comparison. {T}hree commonly used test statistics, the sample
	mean, {SAM} statistic and {S}tudent's t-statistic, are considered.
	{T}he results show that the standard permutation method overestimates
	{FDR}. {T}he overestimation is the most severe for the sample mean
	statistic while the least for the t-statistic with the {SAM}-statistic
	lying between the two extremes, suggesting that one has to be cautious
	when using the standard permutation-based {FDR} estimates to evaluate
	various statistical methods. {I}n addition, our proposed {FDR} estimation
	method is simple and outperforms the standard method.},

	at an exponential rate, there is clearly a need for more reliable

	algorithm for solving the domain decomposition problem, using a graph-theoretic
	approach. {W}e have formulated the problem as a network flow problem,
	in which each residue of a protein is represented as a node of the
	network and each residue--residue contact is represented as an edge
	with a particular capacity, depending on the type of the contact.
	{A} two-domain decomposition problem is solved by finding a bottleneck
	(or a minimum cut) of the network, which minimizes the total cross-edge
	capacity, using the classical {F}ord--{F}ulkerson algorithm. {A}
	multi-domain decomposition problem is solved through repeatedly solving
	a series of two-domain problems. {T}he algorithm has been implemented

	{T}he decomposition results are 78.2\% in agreement with the literature
	on both the number of decomposed domains and the assignments of residues
	to each domain, which compares favorably to existing programs. {O}n

	96.7\% of the residues correctly when we require that the number

	We find that unigrams follow a Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution. Text

	always highly significant. The model performance is evaluated using
	information-theoretic measures and cross-validation. The model can
	restore doubtfully read texts with an accuracy of about 75\%. We
	find that a quadrigram Markov chain saturates information theoretic

  abstract = {B{ACKGROUND}: {DNA} tracts composed of only two bases are possible
	in six combinations: {A}+{G} (purines, {R}), {C}+{T} (pyrimidines,
	{Y}), {G}+{T} ({K}eto, {K}), {A}+{C} ({I}mino, {M}), {A}+{T} ({W}eak,
	{W}) and {G}+{C} ({S}trong, {S}). {I}t is long known that all-pyrimidine
	tracts, complemented by all-purines tracts ("{R}.{Y} tracts"), are
	excessively present in analyzed {DNA}. {W}e have previously shown
	that {R}.{Y} tracts are in vast excess in yeast promoters, and brought
	evidence for their role in gene regulation. {H}ere we report the
	systematic mapping of all six binary combinations on the level of
	complete sequenced chromosomes, as well as in their different subregions.
	{RESULTS}: {DNA} tracts composed of the above binary base combinations
	have been mapped in seven sequenced chromosomes: {H}uman chromosomes
	21 and 22 (the major contigs); {D}rosophila melanogaster chr. 2{R};
	{C}aenorhabditis elegans chr. {I}; {A}rabidopsis thaliana chr. {II};
	{S}accharomyces cerevisiae chr. {IV} and {M}. jannaschii. {A} huge
	over-representation, reaching million-folds, has been found for very
	long tracts of all binary motifs except {S}, in each of the seven
	organisms. {L}ong {R}.{Y} tracts are the most excessive, except in
	{D}. melanogaster, where the {K}.{M} motif predominates. {S} ({G},
	{C} rich) tracts are in excess mainly in {C}p{G} islands; the {W}
	motif predominates in bacteria. {M}any excessively long {W} tracts
	are nevertheless found also in the archeon and in the eukaryotes.
	{T}he survey of complete chromosomes enables us, for the first time,
	to map systematically the intergenic regions. {I}n human and other
	chromosomes we find the highest over-representation of the binary
	{DNA} tracts in the intergenic regions. {T}hese over-representations
	are only partly explainable by the presence of interspersed elements.
	{CONCLUSIONS}: {T}he over-representation of long {DNA} tracts composed
	of five of the above motifs is the largest deviation from randomness
	so far established for {DNA}, and this in a wide range of eukaryotic
	and archeal chromosomes. {A} propensity for ready {DNA} unwinding
	is proposed as the functional role, explaining the evolutionary conservation

	that the expression for most of the {A}rabidopsis {MYB} genes were

	{A} phylogenetic comparison of the members of this superfamily in

	underwent a rapid expansion after its divergence from monocots but

	{P}revious tools fall short of this goal. {RESULTS}: {CM}finder is
	a new tool to predict {RNA} motifs in unaligned sequences. {I}t is
	an expectation maximization algorithm using {C}ovariance {M}odels
	for motif description, featuring novel integration of multiple techniques
	for effective search of motif space, and a {B}ayesian framework that
	blends mutual information-based and folding energy-based approaches
	to predict structure in a principled way. {E}xtensive tests show
	that our method works well on data sets with either low or high sequence
	similarity, is robust to inclusion of lengthy extraneous flanking
	sequence and/or completely unrelated sequences, and is reasonably
	fast and scalable. {I}n testing on 19 known nc{RNA} families, including
	some difficult cases with poor sequence conservation and large indels,
	our method demonstrates excellent average per-base-pair accuracy--79\%
	compared to at most 60\% for alternative methods. {M}ore importantly,
	the resulting probabilistic model can be directly used for homology
	search, allowing iterative refinement of structural models based
	on additional homologs. {W}e have used this approach to obtain highly
	accurate covariance models of known {RNA} motifs based on small numbers
	of related sequences, which identified homologs in deeply-diverged
	species. {AVAILABILITY}: {S}upplementary technical details, results

	and intron-exon boundaries of the cardiac beta myosin heavy chain
	gene (MYH7) were screened by DHPLC for mutation identification in
	150 unrelated patients diagnosed with FHC. One hundred and forty
	patients with sporadic MND were genotyped for the A67T SNP in the
	poliovirus receptor gene. All DHPLC positive signals were confirmed
	by conventional methods. RESULTS: Mutation screening of MYH7 covered
	10 kb with a total of 5700 amplicons, and more than 6750 DHPLC injections
	were completed within 35 days. The causative mutation was identified
	in 14\% of FHC cases, including seven novel missense mutations (L227V,
	E328G, K351E, V411I, M435T, E894G, and E927K). Genotyping of the
	A67T SNP was performed at two different temperatures both in MND
	cases and 280 controls. This coding SNP was found more frequently
	in MND cases (13.6\%) than in controls (6.8\%). Furthermore, 19 and
	two SNPs were identified in MYH7 and the poliovirus receptor gene,
	respectively, during DHPLC screening. CONCLUSIONS: DHPLC is a high
	throughput, sensitive, specific, and robust platform for the detection
	of DNA variants, such as disease causing mutations or SNPs. It enables

	compare four statistical approaches and models for the analysis of

	regression analysis model was developed to derive {D}elta{D}elta{C}t
	from estimation of interaction of gene and treatment effects. {I}n
	the second approach, an {ANCOVA} (analysis of covariance) model was

	of effects of variables. {T}he other two models involve calculation
	{D}elta{C}t followed by a two group t-test and non-parametric analogous

	{S}equencing {P}roject, pseudomolecules, or virtual contigs, of the
	12 rice chromosomes were constructed. {O}ur most recent release,
	version 3, represents our third build of the pseudomolecules and
	is composed of 98\% finished sequence. {G}enes were identified using
	a series of computational methods developed for {A}rabidopsis ({A}rabidopsis
	thaliana) that were modified for use with the rice genome. {I}n release
	3 of our annotation, we identified 57,915 genes, of which 14,196
	are related to transposable elements. {O}f these 43,719 non-transposable
	element-related genes, 18,545 (42.4\%) were annotated with a putative
	function, 5,777 (13.2\%) were annotated as encoding an expressed
	protein with no known function, and the remaining 19,397 (44.4\%)
	were annotated as encoding a hypothetical protein. {M}ultiple splice
	forms (5,873) were detected for 2,538 genes, resulting in a total
	of 61,250 gene models in the rice genome. {W}e incorporated experimental
	evidence into 18,252 gene models to improve the quality of the structural
	annotation. {A} series of functional data types has been annotated
	for the rice genome that includes alignment with genetic markers,
	assignment of gene ontologies, identification of flanking sequence
	tags, alignment with homologs from related species, and syntenic
	mapping with other cereal species. {A}ll structural and functional
	annotation data are available through interactive search and display
	windows as well as through download of flat files. {T}o integrate
	the data with other genome projects, the annotation data are available
	through a {D}istributed {A}nnotation {S}ystem and a {G}enome {B}rowser.

  abstract = {M{OTIVATION}: {A} fundamental problem of computational genomics is
	identifying the genes that respond to certain endogenous cues and
	environmental stimuli. {T}his problem can be referred to as targeted
	gene finding. {S}ince gene regulation is mainly determined by the
	binding of transcription factors and cis-regulatory {DNA} sequences,
	most existing gene annotation methods, which exploit the conservation
	of {ORF}s, are not effective in finding target genes. {RESULTS}:
	{A} viable approach to targeted gene finding is to exploit the cis-regulatory
	elements that are known to be responsible for the transcription of
	target genes. {G}iven such cis-elements, putative target genes whose
	promoters contain the elements can be identified. {A}s a case study,
	we apply the above approach to predict the genes in model plant {A}rabidopsis
	thaliana which are inducible by a plant phytohormone, abscisic acid
	({ABA}), and abiotic stress, such as drought, cold and salinity.
	{W}e first construct and analyze two {ABA} specific cis-elements,
	{ABA} responsive element ({ABRE}) and its coupling element ({CE}),
	in {A}. thaliana, based on their conservation in rice and other cereal
	plants. {W}e then use the {ABRE}-{CE} module to identify putative
	{ABA}-responsive genes in {A}. thaliana. {B}ased on {RT}-{PCR} verification
	and the results from literature, this method has an accuracy rate
	of 67.5\% for the top 40 predictions. {T}he cis-element based targeted
	gene finding approach is expected to be widely applicable since a
	large number of cis-elements in many species are available.},

	{A}nalyses suggest that the {C}-terminal domain of the two-{WRKY}-domain
	encoding gene appears to be the ancestor of the single-{WRKY}-domain
	encoding genes, and that the {WRKY} domains may be phylogenetically

	of the molecular mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation

	important implications in tree biotechnology. Although a number of
	transcription factors in tree species have been shown to be associated
	with wood formation and some of them are implicated in lignin biosynthesis,
	none of them have been demonstrated to be key regulators of the biosynthesis
	of all three major components of wood. In this report, we have identified
	a group of NAC domain transcription factors, PtrWNDs, that are preferentially
	expressed in developing wood of poplar (Populus trichocarpa). Expression
	of PtrWNDs in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) snd1 nst1 double

	in Arabidopsis induced the expression of secondary wall-associated
	transcription factors and secondary wall biosynthetic genes and,
	concomitantly, the ectopic deposition of cellulose, xylan, and lignin.
	Furthermore, PtrWND2B and PtrWND6B were able to activate the promoter
	activities of a number of poplar wood-associated transcription factors
	and wood biosynthetic genes. Together, these results demonstrate
	that PtrWNDs are functional orthologs of SND1 and suggest that PtrWNDs

	factors. Further testing reveals that the promoters of these poplar
	wood-associated transcription factors are also activated by other

  abstract = {B{ACKGROUND}: {M}icro{RNA}s (mi{RNA}s) are a novel class of non-coding
	small {RNA}s. {I}n mammalian cells, mi{RNA}s repress the translation
	of messenger {RNA}s (m{RNA}s) or degrade m{RNA}s. mi{RNA}s play important
	roles in development and differentiation, and they are also implicated
	in aging, and oncogenesis. {P}redictions of targets of mi{RNA}s suggest
	that they may regulate more than one-third of all genes. {T}he overall
	functions of mammalian mi{RNA}s remain unclear. {C}ombinatorial regulation
	by transcription factors alone or mi{RNA}s alone offers a wide range
	of regulatory programs. {H}owever, joining transcriptional and post-transcriptional
	regulatory mechanisms enables higher complexity regulatory programs
	that in turn could give cells evolutionary advantages. {I}nvestigating
	coordinated regulation of genes by mi{RNA}s and transcription factors
	({TF}s) from a statistical standpoint is a first step that may elucidate
	some of their roles in various biological processes. {RESULTS}: {H}ere,
	we studied the nature and scope of coordination among regulators
	from the transcriptional and mi{RNA} regulatory layers in the human
	genome. {O}ur findings are based on genome wide statistical assessment
	of regulatory associations ("interactions") among the sets of predicted
	targets of mi{RNA}s and sets of putative targets of transcription
	factors. {W}e found that combinatorial regulation by transcription
	factor pairs and mi{RNA} pairs is much more abundant than the combinatorial
	regulation by {TF}-mi{RNA} pairs. {I}n addition, many of the strongly
	interacting {TF}-mi{RNA} pairs involve a subset of master {TF} regulators
	that co-regulate genes in coordination with almost any mi{RNA}. {A}pplication
	of standard measures for evaluating the degree of interaction between
	pairs of regulators show that strongly interacting {TF}-mi{RNA},
	{TF}-{TF} or mi{RNA}-mi{RNA} pairs tend to include {TF}s or mi{RNA}s
	that regulate very large numbers of genes. {T}o correct for this
	potential bias we introduced an additional {B}ayesian measure that
	incorporates not only how significant an interaction is but also
	how strong it is. {P}utative pairs of regulators selected by this
	procedure are more likely to have biological coordination. {I}mportantly,
	we found that the probability of a {TF}-mi{RNA} pair forming feed
	forward loops with its common target genes (where the mi{RNA} simultaneously
	suppresses the {TF} and many of its targets) is increased for strongly
	interacting {TF}-mi{RNA} pairs. {CONCLUSION}: {G}enes are more likely
	to be co-regulated by pairs of {TF}s or pairs of mi{RNA}s than by
	pairs of {TF}-mi{RNA}, perhaps due to higher probability of evolutionary
	duplication events of shorter {DNA} sequences. {N}evertheless, many
	gene sets are reciprocally regulated by strongly interacting pairs
	of {TF}-mi{RNA}, which suggests an effective mechanism to suppress
	functionally related proteins. {M}oreover, the particular type of
	feed forward loop (with two opposing modes where the {TF} activates
	its target genes or the mi{RNA} simultaneously suppresses this {TF}
	and the {TF}-mi{RNA} joint target genes) is more prevalent among
	strongly interacting {TF}-mi{RNA} pairs. {T}his may be attributed
	to a process that prevents waste of cellular resources or a mechanism
	to accelerate m{RNA} degradation.},

	basis for the folding model is presented in detail, with references
	given for both specific free energy parameters and to overview articles
	that have summarized the state of these nearest neighbor parameters
	over the past dozen years. {B}oth {RNA} and {DNA} rules are discussed,
	with some mention of parameters for {RNA}/{DNA} hybridization. {A}lthough
	the thermodynamic model has grown in complexity to accommodate new
	types of information, the folding algorithm has not yet incorporated
	some features, such as coaxial stacking of adjacent helices, and
	other features will probably remain too difficult or computationally
	expensive to implement. {F}or this reason, a new energy calculation
	program has been introduced to recompute the free energies of predicted
	foldings to reflect the best of our knowledge. {T}he most significant
	improvements in the mfold software are: 1. {F}olding times have been
	greatly reduced in recent years, partly because of faster computers
	and partly because of improvements in the algorithm. 2. {F}olding
	constraints have been expanded and are now implemented without the
	use of bonus energies that distort the results. 3. {T}he output is
	significantly improved. {C}lear and enlargeable images of dot plots
	and of predicted foldings are now produced in {P}ost{S}cript and
	gif formats. {B}ases in structures may be annotated using different
	colors that reflect how well-determined they are in terms of their
	tendency to pair with other bases or to be singlestranded. {S}imilarly,
	base pair probabilities from partition function calculations may
	be used for annotation. {A} detailed decomposition of each predicted
	folding into stacked pairs and loops with associated free energies
	is now provided. {T}he mfold software has a variety of parameters
	that may be adjusted to improve the predictions. {S}everal examples
	are presented to illustrate how to interpret folding results and
	how to adjust these parameters to obtain better results.},

  abstract = {The nuclear genome of {A}rabidopsis thaliana was sequenced to near
	completion a few years ago, and ahead lies the challenge of understanding
	its meaning and discerning its potential. {H}ow many genes are there?
	{W}hat are they? {W}hat do they do? {C}omputer algorithms combined
	with genome array technologies have proven efficient in addressing
	the first two questions as shown in a recent report ({Y}amada et
	al., 2003). {H}owever, assessing the function of every gene in every
	cell will require years of careful analyses of the phenotypes caused
	by mutations in each gene. {C}urrent progress in generating large
	numbers of molecular markers and near-saturation insertion mutant
	collections has immensely facilitated functional genomics studies
	in {A}rabidopsis. {I}n this review, we focus on how gene function
	can be revealed through the analysis of mutants by either forward
	or reverse genetics. {T}hese mutants generally fall into two distinct
	classes. {T}he first class typically includes point mutations or
	small deletions derived from chemical or fast neutron mutagenesis
	whereas the second class includes insertions of transferred-{DNA}
	or transposon elements. {W}e describe the current methods that are
	used to identify the gene corresponding to these mutations, which
	can then be used as a probe to further dissect its function.},
